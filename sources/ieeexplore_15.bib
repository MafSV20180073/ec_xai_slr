  abstract={The transformer model has demonstrated significant capabilities in various intelligent tasks, attracting widespread attention in recent years. However, it involves numerous complex operations, including large-bit-width multiplication, division, matrix transposition, and exponentiation. These require substantial storage and computational resources, making it challenging to deploy on edge devices. This work introduces a neuromorphic transformer architecture with low hardware cost for AI edge computing (AI-EC). At the structural level, it absorbs scaling factors within the self-attention mechanism into weight matrixes, thereby eliminating the division caused by the scaling operation. Additionally, a transposition calculation method is proposed to perform matrix transposition using dedicated memory access strategies and optimized data flow designs, which reduces logic resource overhead and avoids memory access discontinuities. At the computing paradigm level, the architecture employs spike-driven computing, substituting multi-bit multipliers with AND logic for synaptic operations. The paradigm introduces high sparsity to computational data, which is effectively exploited to reduce the computational workload of the architecture. The results indicate that the architecture successfully eliminates high-cost operators and significantly reduces computational expenses. Eventually, this architecture is verified as a prototype using a 28 nm CMOS process library, demonstrating a compact logic area of sub-0.2 mm2 and a high energy efficiency of 0.34 pJ/SOP @ 50MHz. This work is expected to promote the application of transformers in edge computing and the development of intelligent edge applications.},

  abstract={Due to the characteristics of the small size and low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Multi-UAV confrontation will play an important role in future wars. The Multi-UAV confrontation game in the air combat environment is investigated in this paper. To truly deduce the confrontation scene, a physics engine is established based on the Multi-UAV Confrontation Scenario (MCS) framework, enabling the real-time interaction between the agent and environment while making the learned strategies more realistic. To form an effective confrontation strategy, the Graph Attention Multi-agent Soft Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning with Target Predicting Network (GA-MASAC-TP Net) is firstly proposed for Multi-UAV confrontation game. The merits lie in that the Multi-UAV trajectory prediction, considering interactions among targets, is incorporated innovatively into the Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling Multi-UAVs to make decisions more accurately based on situation prediction. Specifically, the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm is extended to the Multi-agent domain and embed with the graph attention neural network into the Actor, Critic network, so the UAV could aggregate the information of the spatial neighbor teammates based on the attention mechanism for better collaboration. The comparative experiment and ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-art performance in the MCS.},

  abstract={The pandemic brought about an unprecedented number of virtual conferences, given the heavy restrictions on travel to in-person meetings. Despite all the advances in technology, people still complain about virtual events. There is Zoom fatigue, confinement malaise, and a longing for personal social interactions. This paper discusses our experience organizing the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (IEEE VR) as a virtual event. IEEE VR was a success with 1200+ registered paying participants, dozens of workshops and tutorials, and hundreds of technical papers. We used (1) a virtual environment platform, together with (2) discussion tools and (3) videoconferencing/broadcast/online tools to further provide effective social interaction and increase engagement. In this paper, we explore the synergies between virtual environments and other online tools and assess user engagement by analyzing the messages exchanged between participants across different genders and geographical regions. To this end, we apply diverse engagement metrics for online conferences. Our analysis shows that these metrics have the potential to highlight engagement, diversity, and inclusion by combining textual messages, participant geographic and gender information, communities of participants, and visitation patterns in a virtual environment. Drawing on our results and experiences, we propose guidelines for organizing technical virtual events to increase diversity and social interaction.},

  pages={27421-27434},
  abstract={In the multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted downlink communication, it is challenging for UAV base stations (UAV BSs) to realize trajectory design and resource assignment in unknown environments. The cooperation and competition between UAV BSs in the communication network leads to a Markov game problem. Multiagent reinforcement learning is a significant solution for the above decision making. However, there are still many common issues, such as the instability of the strategy and low utilization of historical data, that limit its application. In this article, a novel graph-attention multiagent trust region (GA-MATR) reinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve the multi-UAV assisted communication problem. Graph recurrent network is introduced to process and analyze complex topology of the communication network, so as to extract useful information and patterns from observational information. The attention mechanism provides additional weighting for conveyed information, so that the critic network can accurately evaluate the value of behavior for UAV BSs. This provides more reliable feedback signals and helps the actor network update the strategy more effectively. Ablation simulations indicate that the proposed approach attains improved convergence over the baselines. UAV BSs learn the optimal communication strategies to achieve their maximum cumulative rewards. Additionally, the multiagent trust region method with monotonic convergence provides an estimated Nash equilibrium for the multi-UAV assisted communication Markov game.},

New AI capabilities can improve efficiency, trust, and efficacy for mission critical applications for tactical autonomy with minimal supervision from human operators in multi-domain battlefield (MDB) environments that are complex, contested and unpredictable. Although AI-enabled tools have been responsive to people and complementary to human capabilities, in order to realize its full potential in tactical applications, there are several challenges to be addressed for making trustworthy, ethical, fair, real-time explainable AI-enabled autonomous systems. Collaborations between platforms/systems as well as joint human-machine learning/teaming could address many of these issues to provide trusted and shared understanding and delivering cost-effective and adaptive systems to assist operations across military domains (space, air, land, maritime, and cyber) at combat speed using a shared set of resources.

  year={2024},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The electric vehicle charging station is a game-changer that supplants the older kind of charging stations. Our futuristic electric vehicle charging station may be installed virtually anywhere, takes minimal space, and operates independently of the government’s power source, in contrast to the current practice of reserving these stations for major urban areas. Among the many global industries that rely on fossil fuels, transportation ranks high. The development of electric vehicles (EVs) and other forms of transportation electrification are thus essential in the fight against carbon-dioxide emissions and the over-reliance on traditional energy sources that are harmful to the environment. At the same time, electricity distribution, use, and supply have been accompanied by massive amounts of data due to the fast digitization of electrical networks and EVs. These datasets may be used to inform choices and insights by using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Despite a number of recent studies in this area, no one has explicitly examined the usefulness of AI for charge-demand profiling, data augmentation, demand forecasting, explainability of demand, and charge optimization of the EVI. For the purpose of efficiently delivering the fast charging function, this study suggested a novel logic called Grid Distributed Fast EV Charging (GDFEVC). To evaluate the proposed model’s efficiency, it was cross-validated with the standard Fast EV Charging Model (FEVCM). This AI framework has been empirically tested on a real-world EVI case study, and the results show that it helps with the new problems with dispersed energy supplies that are coming up with EV adoption.},

  title={Mimicking the Brain’s Cognition of Sarcasm From Multidisciplines for Twitter Sarcasm Detection}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={34},
  number={1},
  pages={228-242},
  abstract={Sarcasm is a sophisticated construct to express contempt or ridicule. It is well-studied in multiple disciplines (e.g., neuroanatomy and neuropsychology) but is still in its infancy in computational science (e.g., Twitter sarcasm detection). In contrast to previous methods that are usually geared toward a single discipline, we focus on the multidisciplinary cross-innovation, i.e., improving embryonic sarcasm detection in computational science by leveraging the advanced knowledge of sarcasm cognition in neuroanatomy and neuropsychology. In this work, we are oriented toward sarcasm detection in social media and correspondingly propose a multimodal, multi-interactive, and multihierarchical neural network ( $M_{3}N_{2} $ ). We select Twitter, image, text in image, and image caption as the input of  $M_{3}N_{2} $  since the brain’s perception of sarcasm requires multiple modalities. To reasonably address the multimodalities, we introduce singlewise, pairwise, triplewise, and tetradwise modality interactions incorporating gate mechanism and guide attention (GA) to simulate the interactions and collaborations of involved regions in the brain while perceiving multiple modes. Specifically, we exploit a multihop process for each modality interaction to extract modal information multiple times using GA for obtaining multiperspective information. Also, we adopt a two-hierarchical structure leveraging self-attention accompanied by attention pooling to integrate multimodal semantic information from different levels mimicking the brain’s first- and second-order comprehensions of sarcasm. Experimental results show that  $M_{3}N_{2} $  achieves competitive performance in sarcasm detection and displays powerful generalization ability in multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition.},

  title={LegalReasoner: A Multi-Stage Framework for Legal Judgment Prediction via Large Language Models and Knowledge Integration}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={166843-166854},
  abstract={Legal judgment prediction (LJP) presents a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence, demanding intricate comprehension of legal texts, nuanced interpretation of statutes, and complex reasoning over multifaceted case elements. While recent advancements in natural language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments; and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8% across all datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each component and provide insights into the model’s decision-making process. Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient, consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes.},

  abstract={Aspect-based financial sentiment analysis (ABFSA) is a fine-grained task that can enrich and sharpen financial analysis by identifying sentiments towards specific entities (e.g., company, stock). As the application of ABSA in professional language, ABFSA is a challenging task requiring extensive domain knowledge while remaining understudied. Numeral understanding is crucial for financial text analysis, but existing NLP models for ABFSA lack such ability by mainly treating numerals as plain text. In addition, most studies on knowledge incorporation disregard necessary domain-specific connotations or suffer from the low coverage issue. In this paper, we propose a novel numeral-oriented network with a multi-source affective knowledge refinement strategy (NumAKEN) for ABFSA. NumAKEN utilizes a numeral encoding method based on DigitCNN to capture critical numeric concepts such as magnitude and category. A multi-source affective knowledge fusion strategy is designed for hybrid lexicon construction and incorporation, which can guide the model to capture significant sentiment clues as well as alleviate conflicting and coverage issues. Extensive experiments on two datasets illustrate that our NumAKEN model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and verify the effectiveness of our model.},

  pages={4946-4960},
  abstract={The mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) continuously requires the expansion of charging resources in the urban area. Such a continuing and dynamic problem associated with multi-level of uncertainties can hardly be tackled by deterministic models. To overcome this challenge, this paper newly proposes a progressive planning scheme (PPS) for dynamic expansion of charging resources deployment. Specifically, a simulation environment is constructed by considering EV user behavior model and evaluation model. Based on this, a tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is proposed to direct the concerned expansion problem, of which the objective is to enhance social welfare while adhering to specific economic and technical constraints. The proposed model leverages an attention mechanism and an inflation coefficient to enable the agent to selectively focus on dominant features and effectively adapt to variable planning schemes. Moreover, the DRL model is incorporated with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to obtain the exploration-exploitation trade-off, through which more valid and generalizable decisions can be generated. Comparative case studies are carried out to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods, which demonstrate averaging 4.79% and 11.38% improvement over the advanced reinforcement learning algorithm and the genetic algorithm in an approximating real-world environment, respectively.},

  abstract={Medical report generation can be helpful in diagnoses. Despite the previous efforts of researchers, current models still need improvements in the extraction of image features and quality of generated reports. In this paper, we propose an attention enhanced network with semantic inspector (AENSI) as a new automatic medical report generation model, which serves to help doctors get a high-quality report. For the model, we propose double-weighted multi-head attention as our attention module, where different heads are aggregated with double weights (DWMHA) to enhance its power in catching subtle features and drawing correlations between images and texts. To prevent the drawback of imprecise multi-label classification modules used in current generation models, we design a novel module following decoder that treats tags as inspectors of the generated reports, namely Tag Inspector, as a substitute for the previous classification module. Experimental results of AENSI achieve to the level of state-of-the-art. On IU X-ray, our model surpasses all previous works on every metrics; on PEIR Gross, our model ranks first on BLEU-4 and ROUGE and closely approaches the best on other metrics.},

  abstract={Due to the characteristics of small size, few color texture features, and blurred object boundaries of moving vehicles in satellite video, traditional methods based on background subtraction or frame difference and deep learning methods based on single-frame images continue to have a high number of false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). In this article, a satellite video moving vehicle detection network, consisting of the historical frame differential module (HFDM) and the improved YOLOv5 algorithm, is proposed. Initially, a multiscene mosaic (MSM) data augmentation strategy is employed to increase the data complexity, thereby improving the detection ability of the model in complex scenes. Then, HFDM is used to extract the motion information in the historical frames and fuse the motion features with the current frame to obtain the information on the spatio-temporal feature, which can compensate for the absence of single-frame image features. Finally, grouping features of multiple consecutive frames are calculated independently using grouping convolution, the down-sampling rate of the network model is reduced, large-scale feature maps are used for prediction, group attention (GA) and path aggregation network (PANet) are used instead to improve the grouping feature expression of consecutive frames, named GA-PANet. Experiments indicate that the method in this article achieves better detection performance and meets the real-time requirements on both test datasets I and II. The method can deal with the problems of false alarms caused by weak color texture features and blurry boundaries and achieve state-of-the-art performance in real-time moving vehicle detection in satellite video.},

  abstract={The phenomenon of nonoverlapping spectral responses is an inevitable but an overlooked problem in the deep-learning-based panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images’ fusion task, which will introduce some error information from the PAN image. In light of this, we construct a novel prior model based on spectral response theory and develop a model-based pan-sharpening network. Specifically, we extract the initial error map from the PAN and interpolate the MS image as the initial pan-sharpened result. Then, two optimization problems regularized by the deep prior are formulated to update the error map and pan-sharpened image. By alternately optimizing the above subtasks, error information is gradually separated from PAN images and the lost texture information in MS images is gradually restored, which can effectively alleviate the negative impact of low coupling information from PAN and MS images. Plenty of experimental results on different kinds of satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed method shows a better balance between interpretability and lightweight structure. The proposed method will be open-sourced in https://github.com/jiaming-wang/DERN.},

  abstract={Learning high-quality video representation has shown significant applications in computer vision and remains challenging. Previous work based on mask autoencoders such as ImageMAE [10] and VideoMAE [23] has proven the effectiveness of learning representations in images and videos through reconstruction strategy in the visual modality. However, these models exhibit inherent limitations, particularly in scenarios where extracting features solely from the visual modality proves challenging, such as when dealing with low-resolution and blurry original videos. Based on this, we propose AV-MaskEnhancer for learning high-quality video representation by combining visual and audio information. Our approach addresses the challenge by demonstrating the complementary nature of audio and video features in cross-modality content. Moreover, our result of the video classification task on the UCF101 [21] dataset outperforms the existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art, with a top-1 accuracy of 98.8% and a top-5 accuracy of 99.9%.},

  abstract={Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have led to the widespread use of Conversational AI in many practical applications. However, it is still very challenging to leverage auxiliary information that can provide conversational context or personalized tuning to improve the quality of conversations. For example, there has only been limited research on using an individual’s persona information to improve conversation quality, and even state-of-the-art conversational AI techniques are unable to effectively leverage signals from heterogeneous sources of auxiliary data, such as multi-modal interaction data, demographics, SDOH data, etc. In this paper, we present a novel Persona-Coded Poly-Encoder method that leverages persona information in a multi-stream encoding scheme to improve the quality of response generation for conversations. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, we evaluate our method on two different persona-based conversational datasets, and compared against two state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our method can improve conversation quality over the baseline method Poly-Encoder by $ 3.32\%$ and $ 2.94\%$ in terms of BLEU score and HR@1, respectively. More significantly, our method offers a path to better utilization of multi-modal data in conversational tasks. Lastly, our study outlines several challenges and future research directions for advancing personalized conversational AI technology.},

  abstract={In practical application, it is difficult to effectively collect fault information of integrated navigation system. Aiming at the problem of few fault samples in INS/GNSS navigation system, an unsupervised integrated navigation system fault diagnosis method (shot for GA-TRANFD) is proposed in this paper. The method uses unsupervised training style, which only needs the normal integrated navigation data to train the fault diagnosis model, so that effectively solves the few-shot data problem. GA-TRANFD enhances the robustness of feature extraction by using a pyramid structure feature extractor, and realizes sequence reconstruction and fault extraction by applying Transformer Network with the idea of generating antagonism, and realizes the function of fault diagnosis. Finally, a published UCR time series data set and integrated navigation hardware-in-the-loop simulation data are used to verify the model. Taking the F1 and ROC scores as the evaluation metrics, which are commonly used in the classification field to represent the accuracy of classification, the experiment shows that the improved model improves the F1 and ROC scores of the references by 20.7%.},

  pages={849-856},
  abstract={To address the issues that current surveillance videos abnormal behavior detection methods are affected by complex environments such as video blurring and long distances, resulting in low detection accuracy and slow speed, we propose an abnormal behavior detection method based on spatio-temporal dual-flow network for surveillance videos. Firstly, the input surveillance videos are sampled with different frame rates and a spatio-temporal dual-flow partial convolution network is constructed to extract spatial and motion information features from the spatial and temporal flow video sequences, respectively. Then, a cross-modal dual-attention fusion mechanism is introduced after each feature extraction of the dual-flow partial convolution network to enhance the exchange of feature information between spatial and temporal flows. Finally, the extracted motion and spatial features are fused to output detection results. Experiments show that our method reduces the number of floating-point operations and model parameters on the Kinetics-600 dataset compared to the MViT-L algorithm with guaranteed accuracy. Compared to lightweight networks such as X3D-XL, it improves the accuracy in Top-1 and Top-5 by 4.3% and 3.6%, respectively. The experiments prove that the method can reduce the model’s computational complexity while obtaining more accurate abnormal behavior detection results when the surveillance videos is blurred or the abnormal behavior occurs far away.},

  abstract={Crowd flow forecasting is expected to have a wide range of applications such as human resource allocation, guidance design, marketing, disaster mitigation and congestion prediction for avoiding epidemic such as COVID-19. Crowd flow forecasting is challenging because it requires considering both the task of capturing the temporal dependency of data and capturing the spatial dependence. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a mechanism for referencing time-series features that are important for forecasting and incorporating graph convolution into Transformer, and we introduce CrowdFlowTransformer(CF-Transformer), a deep learning model based on Google's Transformer framework captures the Spatio-temporal dependency of time series. CF-Transformer captures the time series dependency by extracting important local time series from the past time series, inputting them to the decoder of Transformer, and encoding critical features into the model's input. We adapted CF-Transformer to a real-world crowd flow dataset. We evaluated it by comparing its forecasting accuracy with conventional models, and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms the conventional models.},

  abstract={Recently, Transformers have been excelling in the field of object tracking. However, most existing trackers tend to indiscriminately increase the number of model parameters in order to enhance tracking accuracy. In contrast, we introduce the Swin-Transformer-Tiny-based Predictive Model for Tracking (STMP). The STMP leverages Transformers for feature extraction and fusion, combines positional encoding and neighboring candidate information, and redesigns the model predictor to accurately locate and estimate target bounding boxes. This renders STMP as a compact yet powerful tracker, with only 32.56M model parameters. Evaluation experiments show that our STMP performs outstandingly on five challenging datasets. Particularly in the GOT-10k evaluation, our Average Overlap (AO) scored an excellent 75.2%, not only far surpassing trackers with similar levels of model parameters but also exceeding most larger model trackers. Simultaneously, we achieved commendable scores of 82.3% and 68.8% on the TrackingNet and LaSOT datasets respectively.},

  abstract={Lossy compression is one of the most effective methods for reducing the size of scientific data containing multiple data fields. It reduces information density through prediction or transformation techniques to compress the data. Previous approaches use local information from a single target field when predicting target data points, limiting their potential to achieve higher compression ratios. In this paper, we identified significant cross-field correlations within scientific datasets. We propose a novel hybrid prediction model that utilizes CNN to extract cross-field information and combine it with existing local field information. Our solution enhances the prediction accuracy of lossy compressors, leading to improved compression ratios without compromising data quality. We evaluate our solution on three scientific datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve compression ratios by up to 25% under specific error bounds. Additionally, our solution preserves more data details and reduces artifacts compared to baseline approaches.},

  pages={521-530},
  abstract={Transformer neural networks (TNN) have been widely utilized on a diverse range of applications, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their widespread adoption has been primarily driven by the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention block used to extract key features from sequential data. The multi-head self-attention block is followed by feedforward neural networks, which play a crucial role in introducing non-linearity to assist the model in learning complex patterns. Despite the popularity of TNNs, there has been limited numbers of hardware accelerators targeting these two critical blocks. Most prior works have concentrated on sparse architectures that are not flexible for popular TNN variants. This paper introduces ProTEA, a runtime programmable accelerator tailored for the dense computations of most of state-of-the-art transformer encoders. ProTEA is designed to reduce latency by maximizing parallelism. We introduce an efficient tiling of large matrices that can distribute memory and computing resources across different hardware components within the FPGA. We provide run time evaluations of ProTEA on a Xilinx Alveo U55C high-performance data center accelerator card. Experimental results demonstrate that ProTEA can host a wide range of popular transformer networks and achieve near optimal performance with a tile size of 64 in the multi-head self-attention block and 6 in the feedforward networks block when configured with 8 parallel attention heads, 12 layers, and an embedding dimension of 768 on the U55C. Comparative results are provided showing ProTEA is 2.5× faster than an NVIDIA Titan XP GPU. Results also show that it achieves 1.3 – 2.8× speed up compared with current state-of-the-art custom designed FPGA accelerators.},

  abstract={Graph active learning algorithms can reduce the amount of labeling and improve the applicability of graph neural networks. However, existing graph active learning algorithms are mainly performed at the node granularity. Those setting does not hold to datasets that are sensitive to edge attributes. To solve this problem, we propose a graph active learning algorithm at subgraph granularity. The algorithm tackles two critical challenges: how to estimate the expected labeling value of subgraphs and how to search for high-value subgraphs in the whole graph efficiently. For the first challenge, we evaluate the expected labeling values of subgraphs based on heuristic metrics, including uncertainty, representativeness, centrality, and diversity. Among them, uncertainty cannot be measured directly. Therefore, we measure subgraph inner cohesion by GNN attention weights and estimate uncertainty based on it. For subgraph search, we propose an efficient subgraph search algorithm. The proposed algorithm includes a simulated annealing search algorithm for a single subgraph and beam search with subgraph-effective reception field algorithms for multiple subgraphs. Experiments demonstrate that the subgraph granularity active learning algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve great results on edge-sensitive datasets.},

  abstract={Tapered anechoic ranges were introduced in the late 1960s. Since their introduction tapered anechoic chambers have become popular tools for the measurement of antenna patterns at frequencies under 1 GHz. Dating back to their first installations, several papers mention the fact that these chambers did not have a spherical wave propagation and thus, the Friis transmission equation to measure gain cannot be applied [1], [2]. The array factor theory of taper chambers presented in [3] states that from the point of view of the antenna in the QZ the tapered chamber appears to be a free space environment. The phase behavior across the QZ, reported in [4] appears to agree with the theory since the phase distribution follows the far field equation. In this paper simulations for a dipole and a biconical antenna are performed that suggest that the array factor theory for the tapered ranges while not perfect provides an approximated explanation for their operation. The simulations confirm the measurements done in [2] and additionally show that at some discrete frequencies the propagation in the tapered range does follow closely the free space attenuation.},

Specifically, with Gas metal arc welding (GMAW). For GMAW it is shown that power drawn by the welder is sufficient to accurately identifying anomalies with an ANN. ANNs can utilize raw data without requiring subject matter experts for preprocessing or feature engineering. Echo State Networks (ESN) can learn from only one data point, one example weld. This is due to their use of the pseudo-inverse matrix method for training. Allowing implementation of NILM in a wide range of manufacturing processes where large amounts of training data are unavailable or impractical to collect. The comparative analysis shows models that train with backpropagation, such as transformers, demand a large amount of training data to get results similar to ESNs, thus they are unrealistic in scenarios with limited training data availability.CCS Concepts• Applied computing → Industry and manufacturing; • Computing methodologies → Machine learning; Artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={As the number of interconnected IoT devices continues to skyrocket, so does the attack surface for malicious actors. loT devices are often resource-constrained and deployed in diverse and challenging environments (e.g., critical infras-tructures), making them susceptible to various vulnerabilities and attacks. Additionally, the attacks are often multi-step, which complicates the detection and mitigation efforts. Without proactive measures, these vulnerabilities can be exploited to devastating effects. In this paper, we propose a proactive defense framework for IoT systems security. We provide a high-level overview of the various components, encompassing training, detection, and attack management. Our approach begins with the design and implementation of IoTEDef, an innovative network intrusion detection system that employs per-step detectors based on the cyber kill chain and self-evolves to enhance the accuracy of the early step detectors. We present experimental results demonstrating significant enhancements in detector adversarial robustness following multiple rounds of evolution. We then briefly describe IoTPredictor, which utilizes real-time alerts generated by IoTEDef to predict potential attack next-steps, and IoTAtM, a system that leverages these predictions to take optimal actions for containing attacks using reinforcement learning. We also present IoTDSCreator, a tool designed to generate realistic datasets of multi-step attacks, serving as a valuable training data source for those components. We conclude by outlining future research.},

  abstract={Matrix decomposition techniques have been successfully applied in the analysis of multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These data-driven approaches that assume the linear blind source separation (BSS) problem can yield an unsupervised and fully interpretable solution when there is a good model match. However, selecting a suitable model order that provides an accurate model match is an important challenge. Replicability and computational reproducibility are two key aspects that are also intimately related to interpretability. Despite clear evidence that solutions with poor reproducibility can lead to suboptimal results, the evaluation of reproducibility in matrix decomposition techniques remains limited in the existing literature. We propose the use of constrained independent vector analysis (cIVA), a state-of-the-art joint BSS technique, to assess the influence of model order selection for replicability and reproducibility. We demonstrate the attractiveness of clVA for replicability by alleviating permutation ambiguity as well as enabling additional quantification opportunities. Our results show that highly reproducible model orders achieve a good model match with highly interpretable and replicable solutions when clVA is applied to four different restina-state fMRI datasets.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based methods have shown their wide application prospects in the field of solid oxide fuel cell(SOFC) prediction.

Therefore, two algorithms are proposed in this study, a feature selection algorithm based on maximum information coefficient and Bayesian information criterion for identifying key variables that are sensitive to changes in the SOFC system, and a prediction model based on a genetic algorithm optimized for sequence to sequence architecture. The M/BIC algorithm reduces the number of features by 62.5% (from 40 to 15), which contributes to the acceleration of the algorithm training and the subsequent sensor layout optimization. The prediction model incorporates a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and a multi-head attention mechanism to capture more information in the input sequence, an encoder-decoder architecture and a Gated recurrent unit to better predict performance trends. Tests with real experimental data show significant changes in feature dimensionality reduction and prediction accuracy.},

However, as the dimension of the data increases, MA also has the problem of weak search ability and falling into the local optimal solution. To solve these problems, this paper combines the idea of collaborative evolution and proposes an improved Mayfly algorithm (CEIMA) suitable for feature selection problems. The CEIMA algorithm first divides the population into two sub-populations and initializes them in different ways to increase the diversity of the population. During evolution, information sharing is achieved through an information transmission mechanism between sub-populations, achieving collaborative evolution between sub-populations to enhance the global search ability of CEIMA. Finally, the mRMR-m strategy is proposed to mutate the global optimal individual based on feature importance, improving the ability of CEIMA to escape from local optimal solutions. Through a comparison with 7 feature selection algorithms on 12 UCI datasets, the effectiveness of CEIMA is proven.},

  abstract={This work proposes a novel Cross-Data Multilevel Attention (CDMA) approach for multi-type speech-based depression detection, encompassing both read and spontaneous speech. The main novelty lies in analyzing the unique and common representations of the two types of speech and integrating them into a unified end-to-end framework with novel Intra-Type Multi-Local Attention (IT-MLA) and Cross-Type Global Attention (CT-GA) mechanisms. In particular, IT-MLA highlights depression-relevant information unique in either read or spontaneous speech via intra-modal attention-aware interactions. Furthermore, CT-GA further emphasises the depression-relevant common information in both read and spontaneous speech, with each type being guided by the other. These multiple enhanced representations are aggregated to produce the final predictions. Experiments conducted on a publicly available corpus of 104 speakers (including 52 diagnosed with depression by professional psychiatrists) demonstrate that the proposed CDMA achieves an F1 score of up to 92.5%, the highest performance recorded on this dataset.},

Motivated by these observations, we propose TORCHGT, the first efficient, scalable, and accurate graph transformer training system. TORCHGT optimizes training at three different levels. At algorithm level, by harnessing the graph sparsity, TORCHGT introduces a Dual-interleaved Attention which is computation-efficient and accuracy-maintained. At runtime level, TORCHGT scales training across workers with a communicationlight Cluster-aware Graph Parallelism. At kernel level, an Elastic Computation Reformation further optimizes the computation by reducing memory access latency in a dynamic way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TORCHGT boosts training by up to 62.7× and supports graph sequence lengths of up to 1M.},

To overcome these challenges, we introduce DBERT-ELVA, a discourse-aware neural summarization model. DBERT-ELVA extracts sub-sentential discourse units, offering a more refined granularity for extractive selection, in contrast to traditional sentence-based approaches. To learn a compressed representation of these discourse units while capturing the inter-dependencies among them, an Autoencoder is designed, utilizing Extreme Learning for improved generalization performance. Experimental evaluations on popular summarization benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including other BERT-based models, by a substantial margin.},

  abstract={Power switching devices serve as critical components in power conversion systems, making their lifespan evaluation essential for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of such systems. To address the limitations of existing statistical data-driven methods, which often exhibit low accuracy, poor stability, and inadequate adaptability in handling complex, nonlinear, and large-scale data, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of these devices. The proposed method integrates the global search capabilities of a genetic algorithm to optimize model hyperparameters with the global attention mechanism of the Transformer model to construct a robust device lifespan prediction framework. Specifically, the study outlines a comprehensive framework for reliability prediction of power MOSFETs and validates the methodology using power cycling test results. The results demonstrate that the optimized model achieves an average absolute percentage error significantly lower than traditional particle filter models, improving prediction performance by a factor of 3 to 5.

  abstract={The last decade of rich data-driven research on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided novel insights into human brain function and aberrant behavior in brain disorders. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely-used technique for data-driven analysis of fMRI data. Spatial ICA is the most prominent variation of ICA and provides replicable and interpretable intrinsic connectivity network (ICN). It assumes common spatial activation across time. However, very recent studies indicate that there is utility in adopting a dynamic spatial activation modeling approach. Characterizing dynamics for both temporal and spatial domains means we have a multitude of decompositions of the already high-dimensional, multi-dataset, and multi-subject fMRI data. Hence making sense of the derived data becomes a significant issue. Here we use topological data analysis (TDA) to identify topological descriptors of the windowed spatially dynamic components of fMRI data. We discover and summarize differences in the spatial dynamics of controls and schizophrenia patients (SZs). We discover that SZs generally have lower Betti numbers and higher Wasserstein distance between spatiotemporal brain states, which provide intuitive summaries of the reduced dynamism SZs exhibit in resting-state fMRI studies.},

  abstract={Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been proven to be a universal and effective deep learning framework capable of achieving remarkable accuracy on Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solution problem. However, certain key components of emerging FNO-based models cannot leverage hardware potential, which makes it difficult to apply in high resolution and high realtime demand scenario. This paper presents a high optimized model called Speed Galerkin Transformer, including multilevel parallel SliceK-SplitK-ReduceK strategy for batched skinny matrix multiplication, memory layout optimization for QKV matrices and positional encodings and multi-head layer normalization fusion, as well as batched transposition optimization with strided scattering and gathering in 2D FNO, and these strategies can achieve $10.29 \mathrm{x}, 4.41 \mathrm{x}$ and 2.38 x speedup respectively under specific configuration. When solving the Darcy Flow equation at 512x512 resolution, the Speed Galerkin Transformer model can achieve about 1.72 x speedup, and achieve more than $\mathbf{9 0 \%}$ parallel efficiency on 8 GPUs.},

  abstract={Symbolic regression provides an analytical method to derive explicit mathematical relationships from empirical data that elucidate underlying processes. The model produced aims to be interpretable and as reliable as a physical law. In this context, a neural network architecture named Equation Learner (EQL) has been crafted to formulate equations via a fully differentiable system. Traditionally, the clarity and precision of EQL predictions are maintained through a hybrid strategy that initially sets to 0 the model parameters' L1 regularization to maximize accuracy, then activates the L1 regularization later in training to drive the model towards structural simplicity. This paper identifies weaknesses in this regularization approach and introduces a continuous adaptive L1 regularization technique, we have named L1adapt. This new approach progressively adjusts the level of constraints on the model weights, finely tuning the penalty intensity in relation to the model’s accuracy as training advances.},

Specifically, the input text is parsed by a dependency parsing module to form a syntactic graph. The syntactic graph is then encoded by a graph encoder to extract the syntactic hidden information, which is concatenated with phoneme embedding and input to the alignment and flow-based decoding modules to generate the raw audio waveform. The model is experimented on two languages, English and Mandarin, using single-speaker, few samples of target speakers, and multi-speaker datasets, respectively. Experimental results show better prosodic consistency performance between input text and generated audio, and also get higher scores in the subjective prosodic evaluation, and show the ability of voice conversion. Besides, the efficiency of the model is largely boosted through the design of the AI chip operator with 5x acceleration.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the parameter space of machine learning (ML) algorithms in aggravating or mitigating fairness bugs. Data-driven software is increasingly applied in social-critical applications where ensuring fairness is of paramount importance. The existing approaches focus on addressing fairness bugs by either modifying the input dataset or modifying the learning algorithms. On the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide finer controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive approach to influence the fairness. Can hyperparameters amplify or suppress discrimination present in the input dataset? How can we help programmers in detecting, understanding, and exploiting the role of hyperparameters to improve the fairness? We design three search-based software testing algorithms to un-cover the precision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space. We complement these algorithms with statistical debugging to explain the role of these parameters in improving fairness. We implement the proposed approaches in the tool Parfait-ML (PARameter FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its effectiveness and utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six social-critical applications. In these applications, our approach successfully iden-tified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the state-of-the-art techniques) the fairness without sacrificing precision. Surprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our approach showed that certain configuration of hyperparameters (e.g., restricting the search space of attributes) can amplify biases across applications. Upon further investigation, we found intuitive explanations of these phenomena, and the results corroborate simi-lar observations from the literature.},

A duality relationship, with respect to a Legendre-type transform, between free energy and Kulback-Leibler divergence measures, is used to show that entropy-regularized prototype-based learning is connected to exponential objectives associated with risk-sensitive learning. We use these results to incentivize the development of entropy-regularized prototype-based learning algorithms by highlighting its properties, including (i) memory and computational efficiency, (ii) gradient-free training rules, and (iii) the ability to simulate an annealing optimization process that results in progressively growing competitive-learning neural network architectures.},

  title={The remote sensing image segmentation of land cover based on multi-scale attention features}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={429-436},
  abstract={Segmentation of land cover in remote sensing images is a task that involves interpreting remote sensing data using machine vision. Satisfying segmentation results in agriculture and forestry regions can guide land resource management, natural environment protection, urban construction, and the distribution of agricultural products. However, the performance of the widely used deep learning segmentation model on high-resolution remote sensing segmentation datasets in agriculture and forestry regions needs to be improved. To solve the problems of poor accuracy and loss of context information in remote sensing image semantic segmentation, this paper proposes an improved semantic segmentation network architecture. The model utilizes multi-scale feature extraction, deploys a multi-layer attention feature fusion module and an up-sampling fusion module to capture high-quality multi-scale context information, correctly handle scale changes, and help narrow the semantic gap between different levels. Finally, the proposed MLP decoder refers to the dynamic up-sampling operator to aggregate the information at different levels to achieve pixel segmentation. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, the researchers conducted experiments on two land cover segmentation datasets. The training process specifically designs data augmentation strategies for remote sensing segmentation tasks to enhance the model’s generalization ability. The final model achieved an mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) of 65.05% on the self-built rural land cover datasets, surpassing the benchmark network UPerNet by 5.92%. On the LoveDA dataset, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with an mIoU of 53.39%, demonstrating its versatility.},

  abstract={This article introduces an advanced methodology for optimal parametric design based on discrete-time analysis findings of a robust force control structure, integrating both a disturbance observer and a reaction force observer. While conventional continuous-time analyses are commonly employed to enhance system performance, offering guidance for stability and robustness improvement, they often fall short in explaining practical implementation instabilities. A significant knowledge gap persists in the systematic design approach for tuning the control system to meet specific desired behaviors. To bridge this gap, this article thoroughly investigates the system's frequency response. Design constraints derived from this analysis process formulate the nominal parameter design as a minimization problem, subsequently solved using a genetic algorithm to determine optimal parameter values. Simulations illustrate the control system behavior, emphasizing the design constraints and optimal parameter design process. The proposed method is applied to a force-controlled spindle via calibrated experiments, providing robust validation. The results unequivocally confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, achieving stability, and robustness concurrently.},

  abstract={This study tackles the problem of fine-art image classification that suffers from both the softness of styles and the absence of labelled datasets. The state-of-the-art with CNNs leverages transfer learning and fine-tuning to overcome the scarcity of traditional datasets, which is not sufficient to extract the nuances within various fine art images. In this paper, a new approach is presented based on the combination of the Xception Neural Network and an Improved version of Human Evolutionary Optimizer (IHEO) to overcome these limitations. The model architecture of the Xception model, which uses a depth-wise separable convolution, allowing for a better capture of complex features, and introduced specialized IHEO, to enhance the task performance on fine art classification tasks. Through extensive experiments on various fine art datasets, such as WikiArt, WGA, and TICC, they achieved better accuracy and robustness over the state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the promise of the Xception/IHEO approach in analyzing images in computational arts and classifications. There is also an analysis of deep representation transferability, where fine-tuning Xception on sentiment forecasting and scene identification is shown to outdo models pre-trained on object recognition. The challenges of fine art classification discussed herein in conjunction with methods for domain-specific weight initialization and optimization will allow for significantly more accurate and interpretable systems in the domain of fine art analysis going forward.},

A custom loss function based on the characteristics of the signals optimizes both signal reconstruction and efficiency prediction, ensuring precise and reliable results.

In this study, the quality of decision-making is investigated by proposing a fusion of two decision tree algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, applied to routine blood test data from patients tested for Covid-19 admitted to hospital in Italy. The combination is achieved using the theory of belief functions, especially Dempster-Shafer theory, to improve classifications previously made by these two learning algorithms. Based on the concepts of uncertainty, an attenuation of masses has also been applied to the probabilities of the least performing algorithm. The attenuation parameter used was defined using genetic algorithm for the optimization of the proposed Probabilistic Ensemble Learning Model (PELM).

  year={2022},
  volume={60},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Hyperspectral images (HSIs) contain rich spectral signatures that reveal more image details and, thus, enable the detection of less noticeable changes on the ground. However, HSI-based change detection (CD) is susceptible to a large amount of irrelevant or noisy spectral and spatial information due to massive spectral bands. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral and spatial attention network (S2AN) for HSI-based CD, which is capable to suppress CD-irrelevant spectral and spatial information via adaptive spectral and spatial attention mechanisms. S2AN takes as input the image patch from the difference map between two HSIs and outputs the status of change for the patch. Specifically, S2AN is composed of several repeated attention blocks, each of which contains the spectral attention (SpeA) module for directly calculating the attention score for each input channel, the Gaussian spatial attention (GSpaA) module that first constructs an adaptive Gaussian distribution and then samples it to derive the attention scores for each spatial position, and the convolutional feature extraction (CFE) module for extracting features from the attention-weighted input. It is worth mentioning that, in addition to the advantage of the attention, GSpaA also reduces the sensitivity of patch size for patch-based methods. To effectively train S2AN when facing insufficient labeled data, a semisupervised strategy that combines supervised and unsupervised methods to augment labeled training data is proposed. Experiments on several HSI datasets in comparison to existing methods show the superiority of S2AN.},

  abstract={Learning effective policies for sparse objectives is a key challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). A common approach is to design task-related dense rewards to improve task learnability. While such rewards are easily interpreted, they rely on heuristics and domain expertise. Alternate approaches that train neural networks to discover dense surrogate rewards avoid heuristics, but are high-dimensional, black-box solutions offering little interpretability. In this paper, we present a method that discovers dense rewards in the form of low-dimensional symbolic trees - thus making them more tractable for analysis. The trees use simple functional operators to map an agent's observations to a scalar reward, which then supervises the policy gradient learning of a neural network policy. We test our method on continuous action spaces in Mujoco and discrete action spaces in Atari and Pygame environments. We show that the discovered dense rewards are an effective signal for an RL policy to solve the benchmark tasks. Notably, we significantly outperform a widely used, contemporary neural-network based reward-discovery algorithm in all environments considered.},

In each case, we take a 16-D feature space and reduce it to a 2-D visualizable landscape. We find that a space obtained from optimization of parameters in Monte Carlo tree search is most directly interpretable to characterize our set of games in terms of the relative importance of imperfect information, adversarial opponents, and reward sparsity. These results do not correlate with a space defined using attributes of the game tree. This dimensionality reduction does not show any general effect as the number of players changes. Therefore, we consider the question using the original features to classify the games into two sets: 1) those for which the characteristics of the game change significantly as the number of players changes and 2) those for which there is no such effect.},

  abstract={This paper introduces the ‘GPT-in-the-loop’ approach, which seeks to investigate the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) within multiagent systems (MAS). Moving beyond traditional adaptive approaches that generally require long training processes, our framework employs GPT-4 to enhance problem-solving and explanation skills. To explore this approach, we apply it to a smart streetlight application in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, wherein each streetlight is controlled by an autonomous agent equipped with sensors and actuators, tasked with creating an energy-efficient lighting system. With the integration of GPT-4, these agents have shown enhanced decision-making and adaptability, without necessitating prolonged training. We compare this approach with both conventional neuroevolutionary methods and manually crafted solutions by software engineers, underscoring the potential of GPT-driven behavior in multiagent systems. It is important to note that these comparisons are preliminary, and further, more extensive testing is critical to determine the approach’s applicability across a wider range of MAS scenarios. Structurally, the paper delineates the incorporation of GPT into the agent-driven Framework for the Internet of Things (FIoT), details our proposed GPT-in-the-loop approach, presents comparative results within the IoT setting, and concludes with insights and prospective future directions.},

  abstract={This paper presents the theory of probabilistic hier-archical supervised ensemble learning (TPHSEL), a classification approach we have developed with the goal of obtaining classifications for material selection with a degree of interpretability of the results. We found that TPHSEL is a competitive classifier, not only for our target application, but also for a broader range of standard datasets, where it outperformed support vector machines, random forests, and optimal classification trees. The dataset we developed the method for within the field of materials science is small (405 entries), leading to relatively low accuracy (81 % to 82 %) for both our method and a deep learning approach used earlier. In this context, we found that selection based on a large vote share left close to 20 % of candidate materials, and in this bracket, accuracy and other model performance metrics are above 0.95. This is excellent news for prioritising experimental targets (and related tasks), as it indicates that it is possible to identify promising candidates based on data that still leaves shortfalls in classification.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a comparison between a collection of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) —specifically, Multilayer Perceptrons— and a collection of Symbolic Regression (SR) models, all developed for predicting fish-deaths due to infectious diseases in aquaculture. The implemented Machine-Learning models are able to identify patterns that indicate an increased risk of fish-deaths, and provide early warning-alerts to fish-farmers and other stakeholders, enabling them to take necessary measures to prevent or minimize losses of fishes. The models were trained using real-world data acquired from a large Greek fish-farming unit, and evaluated in a validation dataset (distinct from the training dataset) based on their Mean Absolute Error (MAE) performance. The study found that, for each disease considered, the corresponding ANN model outperformed the respective SR model in terms of MAE. However, the ANNs sacrificed interpretability for higher performance, while the developed SR models, despite lower performance, managed to produce transparent and understandable mathematical expressions for estimating fish-deaths.

  abstract={Although the impressive performance in visual grounding, the prevailing approaches usually exploit the visual backbone in a passive way, i.e., the visual backbone extracts features with fixed weights without expression-related hints. The passive perception may lead to mismatches (e.g., redundant and missing), limiting further performance improvement. Ideally, the visual backbone should actively extract visual features since the expressions already provide the blueprint of desired visual features. The active perception can take expressions as priors to extract relevant visual features, which can effectively alleviate the mismatches. Inspired by this, we propose an active perception Visual Grounding framework based on Language Adaptive Weights, called VG-LAW. The visual backbone serves as an expression-specific feature extractor through dynamic weights generated for various expressions. Benefiting from the specific and relevant visual features extracted from the language-aware visual backbone, VG-LAW does not require additional modules for cross-modal interaction. Along with a neat multi-task head, VG-LAW can be competent in referring expression comprehension and segmentation jointly. Extensive experiments on four representative datasets, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReferItGame, validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract={Frame quality deterioration is one of the main challenges in the field of video understanding. To compensate for the information loss caused by deteriorated frames, recent approaches exploit transformer-based integration modules to obtain spatio-temporal information. However, these integration modules are heavy and complex. Furthermore, each integration module is specifically tailored for its target task, making it difficult to generalise to multiple tasks. In this paper, we present a neat and unified framework, called Spatio-Temporal Prompting Network (STPN). It can efficiently extract robust and accurate video features by dynamically adjusting the input features in the backbone network. Specifically, STPN predicts several video prompts containing spatio-temporal information of neighbour frames. Then, these video prompts are prepended to the patch embeddings of the current frame as the updated input for video feature extraction. Moreover, STPN is easy to generalise to various video tasks because it does not contain task-specific modules. Without bells and whistles, STPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used datasets for different video understanding tasks, i.e., ImageNetVID for video object detection, YouTubeVIS for video instance segmentation, and GOT-10k for visual object tracking.

  abstract={With the development of Mashup technique, the number of Web APIs released on the Web continues to grow year by year. However, it is a challenging issue to find and select the desirable Web APIs among the large amount of Web APIs. Consequently, interactive Web API recommendation is used to alleviate the difficulty of service selection, when users or developers try to invoke Web APIs for solving their business requirements or software development requirements. Currently, there are several collaborative filtering based approaches proposed for Web API recommendation, while their recommendation performance is limited on both optimality and scalability. This paper proposes a light neural graph collaborative filtering based Web API recommendation approach, named LNGCF. Specifically, LNGCF learns user and item embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and uses the weighted summation of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and train. A set of experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial improvements on both optimality and scalability over the baselines.},

  abstract={This paper explores the dynamics of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in public spaces, focusing on how humanoid robots engage with human crowds in the competitive RoboCup Soccer environment. We examine the role of spectatorship, where emotional engagement arises through indirect observation of engineering-driven competition, drawing parallels between human soccer and robot sports. The potential for autonomous systems to elicit collective emotions and systematically study such experiences is investigated. Using the Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Systems (ALFUS) framework, we assess RoboCup soccer robots' autonomy in terms of mission complexity (MC), environmental complexity (EC), and external system independence (ESI). Additionally, the Autonomy and Technology Readiness Assessment (ATRA) method supports gradual capability enhancement, providing a roadmap to higher autonomy. Based on this established methodology, we introduce the Robot-Crowd Interaction Framework (R-CIF), a novel conceptual framework defining the roles of actors involved, to connect theoretical insights with real-world applications. This work highlights the significance of crowd affectivity in robotic sports to boost public engagement and proposes directions for future research on collective emotional dynamics in HRI.},

  pages={3020-3032},
  abstract={Due to the existence of the neutral point (NP) voltage, controlling the three-level inverters has essentially become a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) that needs to provide stable output voltages for the load and maintain the NP voltage simultaneously. Traditionally, this MOOP is converted into a single-objective optimization problem by weighting factors. However, since the physical dimensions of the two control objectives are usually different, it is challenging to choose proper weighting factors to obtain a satisfactory performance according to a specific theory. To address this issue, a tolerant sequential model predictive control (TSMPC) utilizing a lexicographic optimization method is proposed in this article. This method establishes two distinct layers for the output voltage and NP voltage, arranging them in sequence according to the importance of control objectives to evaluate all voltage vectors. By using an explainable tolerance value rather than conventional weighting factors, the proposed TSMPC algorithm presents superior performance over traditional MPC approaches. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed TSMPC algorithm have been verified through relevant experiments and the stability of this algorithm has also been analyzed.},

In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework (MAPIC) to enhance the mapping of cores to the Input-Output (IO) pairs in the network, aiming to generate an optimal test schedule for the NoC-based system. Pointer network architecture has been used for generating the mapping solution and ChatGPT 4o has been used to generate $NoC$ benchmarks from an IP core repository.

By merging the related physical formulas for antenna synthesis into the loss function, the physics-aware neural network (PANN) generates the solution space, comprising the amplitude and phase of the array factor; then, the confrontation between expected and predicted beam patterns directs PAGAN with the PANN module to produce the desired radiation pattern. In the process, we integrate physical information and penalty terms to improve physical interpretability and guide the model toward consistent physical solutions, respectively. In addition, a new masking and encoding technique is established to guarantee the continuity of differentiation in the solution space and handle variable-length inputs. As shown by numerical examples, compared with existing methods, our proposed unsupervised machine learning method achieves the desired radiation pattern with fewer antennas automatically and in a faster and more efficient way.},

  abstract={Towards addressing the issues of poor image quality and limited sample quantity in underwater sonar images. A genetic encoding method for the fusion of image spot and local binary pattern texture features is employed in this study. By encoding the fusion features using genetic algorithms, the dimensionality of the fused features is reduced, thereby enhancing the efficiency of neural network operations while ensuring data transmission confidentiality. Additionally, a deep multi-classifier is introduced, which combines residual units with CNN-BiGRU-Attention. This classifier takes the genetically encoded fused features as input and outputs four predicted probabilities. Through an ensemble learning strategy that evenly assigns weights to the predicted probabilities, the final prediction result is obtained, achieving underwater target recognition. Results demonstrate that the proposed fusion features effectively enlarge inter-class differences among various types of sonar images and improve classifier accuracy. The deep multi-classifier model exhibits stable improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the original model, converging after only 15 training iterations with an average recognition accuracy of 99.1%. The research findings offer an effective approach for target sonar image recognition and classification, with potential applicability to a wider range of underwater target categorization.},

  year={2025},
  volume={74},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Stereo image quality assessment (SIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and improving the visual experience of 3D content. Existing visual properties-based methods for the SIQA have achieved promising performance. However, these approaches either ignore the top-down philosophy or make limited attempts, leading to a lack of a comprehensive grasp of the human visual system (HVS) and the SIQA. This article presents a novel stereo attention network (SATNet), which employs a top-down perspective to guide the quality assessment process. Specifically, our generalized stereo attention (SAT) structure adapts components and input/output for stereo scenarios. It leverages the fusion-generated attention map as a higher-level binocular modulator to influence two lower-level monocular features, allowing progressive recalibration of both throughout the pipeline. Additionally, we introduce an energy coefficient (EC) to flexibly tune the magnitude of binocular response, accounting for the fact that binocular responses in the primate primary visual cortex are less than the sum of monocular responses. To extract the most discriminative quality information from the summation and subtraction of the two branches of monocular features, we utilize a dual-pooling strategy that applies min-pooling and max-pooling operations to the respective branches. Experimental results highlight the superiority of our top-down method in advancing the state-of-the-art in the SIQA field. The code is available at https://github.com/HuilinZhang7/SATNet.},

  abstract={The accurate behavior prediction of autonomous vehicles relied heavily on precise data supplied by various sensors. In spite of this, data missing due to a communication barrier or equipment failure is an unavoidable issue in the process of data acquisition, which significantly impacts lane-changing (LC) prediction. To solve this issue, the influence of data missing on lane change prediction was explored from the several aspects such as missing pattern, missing proportion and data interpolation. The different degrees of data missing in three patterns, namely block missing, temporally correlated missing and random missing, were examined. Missing values are repaired and LC behavior is predicted based on machine/deep learning models, and hyperparameters are optimized using genetic algorithms. By analyzing the factors that affect the model's generalization ability, the difference between the best data repair result and the best prediction result was further explored. The results show that: (1) the proposed methods can effectively solve the problems of data missing repair and prediction accuracy, especially the KNNImputer for repair and the Transformer for prediction; (2) temporally correlated missing is inferior to random missing for filling in errors, but superior for prediction performances. This indicates that the selection of repair methods should take into account not only the best data imputation, but also the best prediction performance; and (3) there are significant differences in the stability of prediction models under different data missing patterns and the CNN-BiLSTM-SA has achieved relatively good performance},

  abstract={With the flourishing development of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, Edge Computing (EC) technology has garnered significant attention along with advancements in communication and IoT technologies. Effectively harnessing the computational resources in the edge environment has become a paramount concern. Accurate workload prediction is considered fundamental to optimizing the utilization of limited edge resources. However, most existing edge cloud load prediction approaches overlook the correlations among edge sites. Moreover, for cloud-native applications, user requests are typically handled by multiple containers. By evolving the work behavior of workload groups, it is possible to achieve a shift from focusing on individual containers to the collective, resulting in higher predictive accuracy. In this paper, the behavior of workload groups is analyzed through the reference to both static and dynamic container information. Leveraging the input data constructed based on the behavior of workload groups, an improved Sample Convolution and Interaction Network (SCINet) is employed for early multi-step prediction of edge container loads. Experimental validation on an edge cloud load dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of edge cloud load prediction.},

  number={6},
  pages={10859-10873},
  abstract={The emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) task is to simultaneously extract emotions and causes as pairs (EC-pairs) from documents, which is important for natural language processing. Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract={The 6G network enables a subnetwork-wide evolution, resulting in a “network of subnetworks”. However, due to the dynamic mobility of wireless subnetworks, the data transmission of intra-subnetwork and inter-subnetwork will inevitably interfere with each other, which poses a great challenge to radio resource management. Moreover, most existing approaches require the instantaneous channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However, to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net, which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and excludes the impact of unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will impact individual throughput. Experimental results prove that our proposed framework significantly outperforms both traditional and MARL-based methods in various aspects.},

  abstract={Road damage detection (RDD) is indispensable for safe autonomous driving. Existing RDD models focus on designing feature representations following expert knowledge. However, collecting and labeling all types of samples is time-consuming and leads to insufficient training data. To alleviate the adverse effect of few training samples, a novel few-shot road damage detector (FSRDD) is proposed in this paper to detect rare road damages. The proposed FSRDD includes three stages. First, fully annotated abundant base classes are leveraged to train a base detector, where ghost attention (GA) and proposal feature metric (PFM) modules are developed to eliminate the redundant information and measure the proposal features, respectively. Second, the recognition branch of the detector is fine-tuned using a few samples of all classes. Finally, the test set is inferred with the help of an offline scale-aware prototypical calibration block (SPCB). Extensive experiments show that our FSRDD achieves 10-shot rare road damage detection with 33.4% and 12.9% mAP50 on RDD and CNRDD datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

  pages={1409-1423},
  abstract={Solar power forecasting is essential for optimizing energy management and ensuring stable grid operations. Accurately forecasting solar irradiance is a key factor to improve solar power forecasts because of a strong relationship between solar power generation and solar irradiance. However, the accuracy of solar irradiance forecasting is affected largely by the limits inherent in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Thus, there exists a notable opportunity to improve the forecast beyond NWP by using data processing technologies. Among them, one is based on the classification of weather patterns. This paper aims to propose several PV power forecasting methods based on weather patterns, and to develop appropriate models for each classification. The proposed five clustering methods include the use of K-Means or SOM algorithm, a time-based classification, an amplitude threshold-based classification using PSO and GWO algorithms, and a season-based classification. Moreover, three up-to-date AI models including XGBoost, GRU, and Transformer were then applied to predict one-day-ahead PV power. Through a systematic experimentation and comparative analysis, the developed forecasting method considering weather classifications with Transformer training model achieves the highest forecasting accuracy on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Furthermore, the forecasting results also reveal the potential advantages for different clustering methods. The time-based and season-based classification models can capture specific climate characteristics of different time periods and seasons, respectively.},

  abstract={Deep networks have made remarkable progress in Multi-View Stereo (MVS) task in recent years. However, the problem of finding accurate correspondences across different views under ill-posed matching situations remains unresolved and crucial. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Geometry-enhanced Attentive Multi-View Stereo (GA-MVS) network, which can access multi-view consistent feature representation and achieve accurate depth estimation in challenging situations. Specifically, we propose a geometry-enhanced feature extractor to explore illumination-invariant geometric features and incorporate them with common texture features to improve matching accuracy when dealing with view-dependent photometric effects, such as shadow and specularity. Then, we design a novel attentive learning framework to explore per-pixel adaptive supervision, effectively improving the depth estimation performance of textureless regions. The experimental results on the DTU and Tanks & Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other advanced MVS models.},

  abstract={Emerging and evolving cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to the private data and assets of government, businesses, and individuals. The timely detection of unknown network attacks is a crucial defense measure to stop cybercrimes. However, the intricate organization and elaborate disguise make the previously unknown attacks hard to pinpoint. In this paper, we propose an approach with an attention encoding and deep metric learning model for intrusion detection. To handle the class-imbalance problem in the training data, we introduced a genetic algorithm-inspired data augmentation, applying the selection-crossover model to generate additional rare-class data. Using the class centers learned by the t-SNE algorithm for the online triplets, we reduced the randomness in the loss function calculation for the Triplet network. The self-attention and channel attention help to find the correlations between the samples and strengthen the mapping power of the low-dimensional metric space. To test the proposed detection system, we used NSL-KDD datasets for evaluation. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods in other research, our system presented a better performance for detecting unknown attacks, with an accuracy of 87% for multi-class classification, improving over 2.8%.},

  abstract={Wind power forecasting is one of the emerging research topics. Due to the curse of intermittency, wind power is tough to study and predict. High precision forecasting of wind is a present urge in order to guarantee smooth operations and planning in power systems. Wind power depends on more than one factor and thus multivariate time series forecasting is the only way by which an attempt can be made to understand wind patterns completely. However, two big challenges that are associated with wind Multivariate time series forecasting (MTFS) is how to reduce the influence of noise components existing in wind and how to select features effectively. This work aims to give the answer to both these questions. To filter out noise and reduce its impact on wind series, Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition using Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) decomposition techniques has been used. By using the recent breakthrough in deep learning, authors use Attention based approach to select the right feature. The entire method consists of three stages namely decomposition, prediction and ensemble. In the decomposition stage, sub series are selected based on their sample entropy and further correlation analysis is done on them. In the prediction stage, Genetic algorithm is applied to search for the optimal values of hyper parameters. Experiments show that sample entropy based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) selection in combination with further correlation analysis helps filter out noise to some extent. Attention based approach in combination with decomposition method performs better over non attention based models in terms of RMSE and MAE scores. However attention based approach is computationally heavy and so an increase in accuracy is obtained at the cost of computational efficiency.},

  abstract={Eye defects of visually impaired people bring great inconvenience to daily lives. With the rapid development of computers and artificial intelligence, some assistance tools and wearable devices have provided convenience to a certain extent, but they still possess many shortcomings, such as high prices, limited functionality, poor real-time performance, the inability to be used offline and so on. This paper designs an offline assistance tool specifically for visually impaired people that can help them perceive their surrounding environments by taking photos and reading the descriptions output by an image captioning model. Considering that the photos taken by visually impaired people may be incomplete, an improved image stitching method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain high-quality stitched images as the inputs of the image captioning model. An improved model pruning algorithm is also designed to compress and accelerate the image captioning model to meet the offline and real-time deployment requirements of portable devices. Experimental results and a practical tool show that the developed system based on an image captioning model and pruning can quickly and accurately describe environments, thus assisting visually impaired people anytime and anywhere.},

  abstract={Recycling and remanufacturing used automobile brake discs is an important measure to reduce environmental pollution and reduce production and manufacturing costs. Previous recycling detection methods mainly relied on manual visual inspection, which had problems such as low inspection efficiency and high missed detection rate. To address this problem, an improved YOLOv5 method for detecting surface defects on automobile brake discs is proposed. We choose the lightweight feature extraction network CloFormer to replace the original YOLOv5 basic network to improve the detection speed while reducing parameter complexity. At the same time, we introduce an improved GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) network branch and use auxiliary classifiers to improve classification accuracy and reduce the missed detection rate. In addition, a genetic algorithm is used for bias optimization in the model fusion stage to improve the overall detection performance of the model. Afterwards, the improved model was compared and verified with similar algorithms on public data sets. Its recognition accuracy was significantly improved by 40.56%, and its mAP gain was 17.96%. It also achieved an FPS improvement of 38.72% and a parameter decline of 4.12%. Finally, when verified in real scenarios, the average accuracy rate was as high as 90.5%, the missed detection rate was 1.375%, and the false detection rate was reduced to 1.5%, achieving the expected results of the experiment. This method can provide a reference for the defect detection method of automobile brake disc recycling.},

  abstract={Vehicles in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are required to continuously broadcast sensitive data including coordinates and speeds. Such practices make sensitive data susceptible to eavesdroppers, undermining location privacy. Conventional strategies attempt to preserve location privacy through different privacy enhancing techniques such as encryption, silent periods, and chaff messages. However, existing approaches fail to simultaneously ensure driving safety and location privacy, particularly against semantic linking attacks by machine-learning-enabled adversaries. To this end, this paper proposes the trajectory converged chaff-based mix zone (TCCM) strategy. It generates chaff messages that imitate real vehicle trajectories to confuse eavesdroppers while maintaining low communication overhead, thereby enhancing location privacy without compromising vehicle safety. Additionally, the TCCM strategy incorporates a genetic algorithm to optimize mix zone placement and ensure a balance between privacy protection and resource efficiency. We implemented a VANET simulation and two adversary attack algorithms to evaluate the performance of our scheme. Reportedly, the TCCM strategy reduces trajectory traceability by at least 24.6% compared with conventional mix zone strategies while maintaining vehicle safety. Additionally, the chaff messages of the TCCM strategy incur 54% less communication overhead than existing chaff-based schemes.},

Subsequently, we simulate the state of the sintering process using our proposed method. To further enhance operational optimization, we introduce an intelligent decision-making strategy that combines dynamic matching of operating modes and a genetic algorithm. This strategy leverages historical data to learn from excellent operation cases while considering the inherent uncertainty in process data. Simultaneously, a model update strategy employing an event-triggered mechanism is introduced to guarantee the process model's comprehensive simulation of the current sintering process dynamics. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to actual industrial process data.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) generates massive amounts of data that are the cornerstone for companies to increase productivity and provide reliable services. Based on these data, predictive and in-depth analysis can be used to identify weaknesses and make improvements. And how to analyze these data efficiently, effectively and safely requires us to explore. We expect to exploit these data by using methods of deep learning, and image captioning is one of the meaningful tasks. Image captioning aims to describe a given image in natural language. It is well believed that mining relationships between objects is a proven method to improve the performance of reasoning. These methods often extract the general relational expressions on another visual relationship benchmark. And it usually brings redundant connections between region pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Alignment Transformer (GAT) that models visual relationships in an unsupervised way to perform multimodal representation. Without taking the pre-training approach to obtain the explicit relational expressions, our model still achieves comparable results. Furthermore, we design a Graph Alignment (GA) module to explore semantic and visual alignment at node-level and graph-level, lead to accurate captions. We measured our method on the benchmark MSCOCO image captioning dataset and conduct ablation studies to investigate its effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to state-of-the-art manners, our propose approach yields an impressive result.},

  year={2024},

  pages={63-69},
  abstract={Accurate short-term electricity load forecasting is essential to ensure the safe, reliable, and economically efficient operation of power systems. However, traditional forecasting methods are increasingly inadequate to meet the demand for ever more precise load predictions. In response to this issue, a CNN-BILSTM-Attention neural network method optimized based on an improved Sparrow Search Algorithm is proposed for short-term electricity load forecasting. Firstly, the Sin chaotic mapping strategy is utilized to initialize the Sparrow population, enhancing the diversity of population positions. Additionally, the cosine optimization algorithm is introduced into the formula for updating the joiner's position. This aims to address the decrease in global search capability in the later iterations of the Sparrow algorithm, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the Sparrow search algorithm; Next, the ISSA algorithm is employed to optimize the CNN-BILSTM-Attention neural network. This helps avoid overly random initialization of the CNN-BILSTM-Attention neural network's initial weight thresholds, thus enhancing the stability of prediction results; Finally, load forecasting is conducted and compared with other algorithmic models for analysis. Additionally, for the WOA-CNN-BILSTM-Attention model, RMSE decreases by 1.832%, with a corresponding MAE reduction of 1.073%. Similarly, for the PSO-CNN-BILSTM-Attention model, RMSE decreases by 1.804% and MAE by 1.026%. The results of the case study demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively enhance prediction accuracy and is valid for short-term load forecasting. By accurately predicting the power demand, the reasonable distribution and optimal dispatch of power can be realized, and the power grid fluctuations caused by the load mutation can be reduced, so as to ensure the quality of power supply.},

  abstract={Mura defects, which manifest as irregularities in brightness and color on display screens, present persistent challenges for Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) manufacturers. While traditional methods effectively detect significant abnormalities in vertical-line inspections, identifying minor defects, particularly Level-1, remains formidable. In this study, we leverage artificial intelligence to address this challenge, focusing specifically on detecting vertical-line mura defects. Given the difficulty in discerning Level-1 defects directly from single images, where higher-level abnormalities are more conspicuous, our approach introduces You Only Look Once-Ghost Attention (YOLO-GA). This advanced YOLOv8-based algorithm is meticulously designed to swiftly and accurately identify vertical lines mura in liquid crystal displays (LCD) images, even amidst complex backgrounds and minor irregularities. To enhance the model’s efficacy, we adopt two pivotal strategies. Firstly, we incorporate the Ghost layer as the backbone and neck network to ensure lightweight deployment while improving feature extraction capabilities, particularly in images with intricate backgrounds. Additionally, we integrate the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) into the network’s architecture, explicitly targeting vertical line mura detection. This augmentation aims to bolster feature extraction and refine detection, especially for defects within liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The dataset utilized in our study is sourced from AUO Corporation and captured using a real single-direction camera. The dataset contains 107,080 images, divided into an 80:20 ratio for training and validation. Each image has a high resolution of  $1624\times 1240$ . Our experimental results show that our approach is highly effective, achieving mAP and F1-Scores of 99.5% and 99.7%, respectively, compared to the baseline model and the comparative attention module. Moreover, the proposed model can significantly reduce the time required to recognize mura defects, fully meeting the manufacturer’s production requirements within a mere 1-second timeframe.},

Test 2 validated model performance on 370 images from external sources, where YOLO.SA achieved 97.48% accuracy, outperforming YOLO.LKA (95.13%). Test 3, comparing with the MTDC benchmark dataset, confirmed YOLO.SA’s accuracy at 95.93%, exceeding previous reports, while YOLO.LKA achieved 95.71%.

To improve the quality and efficiency of visual information transmission and avoid the limitation of the observer due to the information cocoon, we propose CoVis, a collaborative framework for fine-grained visual understanding. By designing and implementing a cascaded dual-layer segmentation network coupled with a large-language-model (LLM) based content generator, the framework extracts as much knowledge as possible from an image. Then, it generates visual analytics for images, assisting observers in comprehending imagery from a more holistic perspective. Quantitative experiments and qualitative experiments based on 32 human participants indicate that the CoVis has better performance than current methods in feature extraction and can generate more comprehensive and detailed visual descriptions than current general-purpose large models.},

  abstract={Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) with limited training samples has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The current research works require to train a dedicated model for each dataset, resulting in limited generalization. Moreover, for the same dataset, a model that has been trained for binary change detection (CD) task usually needs to be retrained for multiclass CD task, thereby leading to low efficiency. We propose a cross-task meta-learning network with graph-enhanced attention module (CMGA) for both binary CD tasks and multiclass CD tasks, aiming to fully extract the spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) and efficiently transfer the prior knowledge to accomplish various HCD tasks with limited training samples. In order to capture general prior knowledge, the multitask meta-optimization is designed to train the pretraining model with the ability of addressing cross-task new classes. Moreover, the diverse tasks are unified into one framework, which aims at identifying the target class from other classes to improve the model efficiency and generalization. The graph-enhanced attention (GA) module is developed to leverage the graph knowledge extract from the graph transformer (GT) module to enhance the pixel-level feature representation.

  abstract={Previous research has shown that robot mistakes or malfunctions have a significant negative impact on people’s trust. One way to mitigate the negative impact of trust violation is through trust repair. Although trust repair has been studied extensively, it is still not known which strategy is effective in repairing trust in a time-sensitive driving scenario. Additionally, prior research on trust repair has not dealt with the effects of expressing emotion in attempting trust repair. In this paper, we presented the development of a variety of trust repair methods for a time-sensitive scenario using a simulated driving environment as a testbed for validation. These trust repair methods included baseline apology, emotional apology, and explanation. We conducted an experiment to compare the impact of these trust repair methods on human-robot trust. Experimental results indicated that the emotional apology positively affected more participants than the no-repair, baseline apology, and explanation. Furthermore, this study identified emotional apology as the most effective method for the time-sensitive driving scenario.},

  year={2024},

  abstract={In 2023 we offered a new model for segmentation of ultrasound (US) images of the breast which combines a grey level mask, Artificial Life (AL) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) [1]. The model has been compared with 14 segmentation models which represented different ways to approach the problem i.e. deformable shapes, machine learning, superpixels, edge linking, Deep learning (DL) networks and various hybrids of DL with the conventional methods. The method outperformed 14 selected state-of-the-art algorithms applied to the US images characterised by complex geometry and a high level of noise. The present paper offers an extension of this algorithm where the step of the thresholding for generation of the image mask (fast but often not accurate) is replaced by a DL method. The proposed structure is a critical modification of the previous idea. It offers a new combination of the DL and AL. The novelty is an efficient compromise between the simplicity of the black-box DL network and the interpretability of the deterministic AL. The trained DL generates a mask which approximates the tumour. Since it is a rough approximation of the object, the DL network performs this task faster than an actual segmentation. Further, the AL exists inside the mask superimposed on the edge map. The AL trained by the GA outlines the tumors. The method shows promising results as applied to segmentation of complex US tumours handling even previously unseen data. The tests based on the characteristics of the US edge maps and the tumour shapes highlight the advantages of the proposed model.},

  pages={406-411},
  abstract={Glioma is a type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells. It can vary in severity and requires accurate grading for prognosis and treatment decisions. Manual grading methods are subjective and prone to variability, leading to machine learning algorithms to automate and improve the process. This research optimizes the machine learning models for glioma grading using three feature selection techniques: Genetic Algorithm-Logistic Regression (GA-LR), Boruta, and CatBoost Feature Importance (CFI). The study compares and analyzes these techniques’ impact on the ensemble models’ performance. The results show that the ensemble model SVM + RF + AdaBoost with CFI feature selection achieved the highest F1-score, i.e., 0.860. The CFI feature selection technique, which can identify relevant feature subsets, demonstrated better performance for glioma grading when compared to the previous study’s results. Therefore, this study concludes that CFI contributes to forming an optimal ensemble model, improving the accuracy of glioma grade classification.},

  abstract={Despite the tremendous impact and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for civilian and military applications, it has reached an impasse as learning and reasoning work well for certain applications and it generally suffers from a number of challenges such as hidden biases and causality. Next, “symbolic” AI (not as efficient as “sub-symbolic” AI), offers transparency, explainability, verifiability and trustworthiness. To address these limitations, neuro-symbolic AI has been emerged as a new AI field that combines efficiency of “sub-symbolic” AI with the assurance and transparency of “symbolic” AI. Furthermore, AI (that suffers from aforementioned challenges) will remain inadequate for operating independently in contested, unpredictable and complex multi-domain battlefield (MDB) environment for the foreseeable future and the AI enabled autonomous systems will require human in the loop to complete the mission in such a contested environment. Moreover, in order to successfully integrate AI enabled autonomous systems into military operations, military operators need to have assurance that these systems will perform as expected and in a safe manner. Most importantly, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) for shared learning and understanding and joint reasoning is crucial to assist operations across military domains (space, air, land, maritime, and cyber) at combat speed with high assurance and trust. In this paper, we present a rough guide to key research challenges and perspectives of neuro symbolic AI for assured and trustworthy HAT.},

  year={2024},
  volume={20},
  number={10},
  pages={11908-11918},
  abstract={Pipeline magnetic flux leakage (MFL) detection is an efficient and energy-saving nondestructive testing (NDT) method. However, under the high-speed detector, MFL signals become distorted with the influence of velocity effects, which adversely affects the accuracy of defect size inversion. The essential cause is the distorted signal multiplicity by velocity effects. In response to this issue, a high-precision defect size inversion method is proposed for the first time, which is called knowledge-guided contrastive fusion network (KCF-Net). First, MFL and eddy current (EC) mechanisms are analyzed, which are concluded that the sensitivity of EC signals to speed is much lower than that to defect sizes, so that EC and MFL abstract features are mined to improve the sensitivity of defect sizes. Moreover, MFL mechanism representations are mined to supervise neural networks to enhance the interpretability of the network. MFL and EC knowledge including abstract features and mechanism representations is fused to highlight the disparities between undistorted and distorted signals and enrich available information. Then, joint decision-making is proposed to eliminate the instability of fusion knowledge and enhance the universality and effectiveness of defect inversion. Finally, the experiments prove the effectiveness of KCF-Net. The length, width, and depth inversion MAEs of measured signals reach 2.2676, 1.6185, and 0.5664, respectively.},

  abstract={The mechanisms underlying dronedarone's role in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias remain unclear under relevant pathological conditions such as the myocardial ischemia condition and the short QT Syndrome condition. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of dronedarone's therapeutic potential, particularly in the context of myocardial ischemia-induced arrhythmias or KCNJ2 D172N mutation-induced short QT syndrome (SQT3). Simulation results suggest that under the SQT3 condition, dronedarone produced a significant prolongation of the action potential duration with the concentrations of dronedarone increased. In contrast, the ability of high concentrations of amiodarone to prolong the action potential duration was actually worse than low concentrations. The maximal slopes of action potential duration restitution curve and effective refractory period restitution curve were decreased in the presence of dronedarone or amiodarone, which decreased instability of re-entrant excitation waves, indicating antiarrhythmic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone on D172N mutation. Significant differences exist in the frequency and concentration-dependent effects between amiodarone and dronedarone. Our results provide possible explanations for the efficacy of dronedarone and amiodarone.},

  abstract={Analyzing the effectiveness of the battery energy storage system (BESS) in smoothing renewable fluctuations correctly is vital to the stable operation of the power system. Therefore, based on stochastic programming and attention-based time series forecasting with learnable and interpretable basis (BasisFormer), we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach for modeling the BESS and analyzing the effectiveness of the BESS in smoothing renewable fluctuations in the bulk power system with high inverter-based resources. The approach considers the attenuation of BESS capacity and the uncertainty of renewable generation. First, we present a scenario generation and reduction method based on Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and the Kantorovich distance. Second, we propose a state of health (SoH) prediction method of the BESS based on BasisFormer. Third, we propose an MILP approach for modeling the BESS and analyzing the effectiveness of the BESS in smoothing renewable fluctuations. Finally, we verify the proposed approach through case studies. The experimental results show that the attenuation of BESS capacity is a crucial factor in correctly analyzing the effectiveness of the BESS in smoothing renewable fluctuations.},

  abstract={Many survivors of cardiac arrest subsequently end up in a coma state, and these patients will go onto achieve varying levels of neurological recovery, ranging from brain death to full recovery. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis can be used to predict the neurological outcome of a cardiac arrest patient, but the patterns are complex and human analysis is time-consuming. We trained a variational autoencoder to extract features from EEGs and used those features in a random forest classifier to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. The resulting model was able to differentiate between good neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1 or 2, versus poor neurological outcome, defined as CPC of 3–5. The final model had a true positive rate of 0.257 and a false positive rate of 0.05. These results demonstrate that it is possible to use variational autoencoders to extract EEG features that are useful for downstream tasks. This opens the door to more interpretable models for EEG analysis in the future. This article was part of ‘Predicting Neurological Recovery from Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023’.},

  pages={190-195},
  abstract={Solar flare prediction presents a significant challenge in space weather forecasting. Currently, existing solar flare prediction tools heavily rely on the GOES classification system. These tools commonly use the maximum X-ray flux measurement within a specific prediction window, often set at 24 hours, as a basis for labeling instances. However, the background X-ray flux experiences considerable fluctuations throughout the solar cycle, leading to misleading outcomes during solar minimum and an increase in false alarms. To address this issue, we propose a new set of solar flare intensity labels computed from GOES X-ray flux, with the aim of enhancing the accuracy of flare prediction methods. Our approach involves innovative labeling methods that take into account relative increases and cumulative measurements across prediction windows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the ‘relative X-ray flux increase’ and provide an explanation of how this metadata is derived. Additionally, we present new cumulative indices and data-driven categorical labels specifically designed for active region-based and full-disk flare prediction models. We also assess the feasibility of integrating our new labels into established solar flare prediction models. Our findings demonstrate that these data-driven labels can be valuable supplements to existing techniques and their integration has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of solar flare prediction tools.},

  abstract={Goal functions make virtual goal-oriented motor tasks easier to analyze and manipulate by explicitly linking movement to outcome. However, they have only been used to study constrained (e.g., planar) upper limb movements. We present a design framework for integrating goal functions with unconstrained postural and upper limb movements in a virtual reality (VR) device. VR tasks designed with the framework can mimic unconstrained natural motions and thus train a range of functional movements yet remain analytically tractable. We created three in-place VR motor tasks: a bow-and-arrow, a reach-and-strike, and a punching bag task. Each task was adjusted to subject-specific workspace limits and anthropometrics. We studied the effects of 3 days of practice and 3 reach/lean distances on task performance in 12 healthy adults. Subjects performed all tasks on day 1 with moderate proficiency and improved with practice at all reach/lean distances. Task-specific results showed that performance decreased and movement variability increased near the edge of the reaching workspace; viewing angles and the imperfect depth cues in VR likely led to biases in performance and practice could attenuate the former effect; in reach-and-strike, subjects learned movement patterns similar to those seen in a real-world striking sport. These results show that our framework can deliver tasks useful for analyzing and training motor performance and can guide future in-place motor training. Post-hoc, we demonstrated the feasibility of generalizable methods that adjust required movement speeds and task difficulty for impaired populations.},

Previously, this topology has been experimentally characterized using PWM and SVM-based modulation at low power, but results have shown problems with THD, efficiency, and transformer saturation. This paper expands on previous work by providing a more thorough explanation of the SVM-based modulation and discussing and validating a power factor control for the topology. The SVM-based modulation is validated in simulation with parasitics and a four-step commutation, with an input and output current THD of 2.7% and 0.2%. In addition, the impact of modulation, parasitics, and commutation on transformer saturation is analyzed, which is an important challenge that has not been previously discussed for this topology.},

  abstract={Detection of obscured P waves remains a largely unexplored topic. This study proposes a weakly supervised learning approach for P wave feature embedding by leveraging surrogate labels and 3265 eight-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) signals with diverse cardiac rhythms, including supraventricular tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and paced rhythms. The proposed method employs a temporal convolutional neural network and multiple instance learning to learn pyramidal feature embeddings that estimate both labeled and unlabeled instances of the P wave. The fine-tuned model achieved a temporally aggregated Dice score of 81.1%, outperforming the baseline model by 1.0%. On the subset with sinus rhythms and minor rhythm irregularities, the model consistently achieved recall and precision of around 84-85% for P wave onset and offset. The framework can be used to learn embeddings correlated with the distribution of the atrial depolarization, using only a fraction of labeled samples. Surrogate labels allow us to embed more detailed context, which may enhance the performance and interpretability of deep neural networks in downstream tasks in the future.},

  year={2023},
  volume={45},
  number={7},
  pages={8372-8389},
  abstract={Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that measure per-pixel brightness differences asynchronously. Recovering brightness from events is appealing since the reconstructed images inherit the high dynamic range (HDR) and high-speed properties of events; hence they can be used in many robotic vision applications and to generate slow-motion HDR videos. However, state-of-the-art methods tackle this problem by training an event-to-image Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which lacks explainability and is difficult to tune. In this work we show, for the first time, how tackling the combined problem of motion and brightness estimation leads us to formulate event-based image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem that can be solved without training an image reconstruction RNN. Instead, classical and learning-based regularizers are used to solve the problem and remove artifacts from the reconstructed images. The experiments show that the proposed approach generates images with visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods despite only using data from a short time interval. State-of-the-art results are achieved using an image denoising Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the regularization function. The proposed regularized formulation and solvers have a unifying character because they can be applied also to reconstruct brightness from the second derivative. Additionally, the formulation is attractive because it can be naturally combined with super-resolution, motion-segmentation and color demosaicing.

  abstract={Data fusion—the joint analysis of multiple datasets—through coupled factorizations has the promise to enable enhanced knowledge discovery, and hence is an active area. Various formulations of coupled matrix factorizations have been proposed, each with its own modeling assumptions. In this paper, we study two such methods, namely Independent Vector Analysis (IVA), i.e., extension of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to multiple datasets, and PARAFAC2, a tensor factorization approach. We demonstrate the modeling assumptions of IVA and PARAFAC2 using simulations, revealing that both methods can accurately capture the latent components, albeit with certain differences in capturing the corresponding subject scores. By making use of a rich multi-task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) dataset, we show how the two methods can be used for achieving two important goals at once, namely capturing group differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls with interpretable components, as well as understanding the relationship across multiple tasks. This is achieved through the definition of source component vectors across datasets.},

  abstract={Autonomous soundscape augmentation systems typically use trained models to pick optimal maskers to effect a desired perceptual change. While acoustic information is paramount to such systems, contextual information, including participant demographics and the visual environment, also influences acoustic perception. Hence, we propose modular modifications to an existing attention-based deep neural network, to allow early, mid-level, and late feature fusion of participant-linked, visual, and acoustic features. Ablation studies on module configurations and corresponding fusion methods using the ARAUS dataset show that contextual features improve the model performance in a statistically significant manner on the normalized ISO Pleasantness, to a mean squared error of 0.1194±0.0012 for the best-performing all-modality model, against 0.1217±0.0009 for the audio-only model. Soundscape augmentation systems can thereby leverage multimodal inputs for improved performance. We also investigate the impact of individual participant-linked factors using trained models to illustrate improvements in model explainability.},
