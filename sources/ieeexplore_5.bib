  abstract={In recent years, the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), exhibiting exceptional performance across a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, despite the high generality of LLMs, there exists a problem in controlling them to produce the desired output for each task. Fine-tuning is a conventional approach to improve performance for specific tasks, albeit at the expense of substantial time and computational resources. Prompt engineering serves as an effective alternative, steering models towards desired outputs for particular tasks, and has been validated to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, manual design of prompts is labor-intensive, which has increased interest in the automation of prompt engineering. In this study, we propose a method to automate prompt engineering optimization utilizing a genetic algorithm with novel genetic operators. Through experiments conducted to explore instructional prompts for solving Japanese multiple-choice questions, the efficacy of the proposed method was affirmed. The findings of this study underscore the feasibility of genetic algorithm-based automatic prompt engineering and genetic operators for prompts, and show their efficacy for Japanese, which has distinct linguistic characteristics compared to English and other languages.},

  abstract={Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning and data analysis, aimed at identifying the most relevant features while reducing dimensionality and computational overhead. This paper introduces a novel Heap-Based Optimization Algorithm (HBO) for feature selection, inspired by the hierarchical structure and priority-driven organization of heap data structures. The proposed algorithm strategically explores and exploits the feature space by prioritizing features based on a fitness function that considers relevance, redundancy, and contribution to model accuracy. HBO employs a heap-based approach to iteratively refine the feature subset, ensuring convergence toward optimal solutions while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that HBO outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art feature selection techniques, achieving higher accuracy, reduced feature subsets, and improved model interpretability. The results underline HBO's effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, reducing redundancy, and enhancing model performance.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={This paper proposes the Large Language Model Assisted Operator Design Framework (LLM-AODF), a novel approach for the automatic generation and optimization of operators within the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA). The framework involves inputting the source code of the fireworks algorithm into a large language model to generate new mutation operators, followed by multiple rounds of iterative optimization of the operator design. By leveraging large language models, LLMAODF can fully automate the improvement of mutation operators in the FWA. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through experiments using the CEC2013 black-box optimization test suite. Experimental results indicate that mutation operators generated by different large language models can improve the performance of the FWA to different extents. An in-depth analysis of the mutation operators generated by various models revealed that large language models can produce complex and diverse mutation strategies through multiple iterations, thereby enhancing the algorithm’s exploration and exploitation capabilities. The framework can be easily extended to different algorithms and various problems, offering a novel approach for the automated design of algorithms.},

  year={2025},

  pages={94-107},
  abstract={Epistasis detection (ED) was widely used for identifying potential risk disease variants in the human genome. A statistically meaningful ED typically requires a more extensive dataset to detect complex disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, but a single institution generally possesses limited genome data. Thus, it is necessary to collect multi-institutional genome data to carry out research together. However, concerns regarding privacy and trustworthiness impede the sharing of massive genome data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel federated ED framework with the sequence perturbation privacy-preserving method to address the limitation of distributed data sharing (FedED-SegNAS). First, to address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models, integrate fuzzy logic into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), promoting the capabilities of CNN to represent the ambiguities of genomic data with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. Second, consider using the neural architecture search method to optimize the federated neural architecture. Specifically, selecting the particle swarm optimization algorithm to automatically search the optimal neural architecture at different stages in federated learning (FL) based on adaptive multiobjectives decreases the communication cost and improves communication efficiency. Furthermore, to ensure the security of the parameter transfer process, design the sequence perturbation privacy-preserving method, grouping the upload and download parameters of FL and randomly perturbing the group number so that the attacker cannot obtain the corresponding result between the group number and parameters. Its rationality and security have been proven. The experiments conducted on a range of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the framework over state-of-the-art ED methods. FedED-SegNAS can reduce network complexity while protecting genome data security.},

  abstract={In this work, I present a methodology for interpreting depth maps obtained from the environment. However, unlike previous studies, the geometry is sequentially estimated by combining CNN classifiers and reinforcement modules rather than using an end-to-end approach. It is assumed that the geometry of the environment is determined from a combination of basic shapes (panel, box, cylinder, sphere). Therefore, the inference process is performed by manipulating the basic geometrical shapes in 3D space. Ultimately, the agent's goal is to compare the depth map obtained from its 3D space with the actual map and approximate it as much as possible. Therefore, the inference process of this algorithm is explainable, and the learning process has the advantage of not requiring a process such as the creation a label manually, and it can run on a relatively small network.},

  abstract={In the new retail era, the sales pace and consumers’ consuming habits are disrupted dramatically by e-commerce and mobile consuming market developments and become various, volatile, and complicated. In sales forecasting, tree-based machine learning algorithms are popular and impressive. Feature engineering, on the other hand, is the most significant impediment to blending business and technological knowledge. An innovative way to solving the feature engineering problem of employing tree-based algorithms in sales forecast is proposed in this work. And a genetic algorithm is presented to enlarge the feature base and to explore potential values from features. To ensure that features with important business characteristics are picked, a novel feature framework for sales forecast is offered. Also given is a genetic algorithm for expanding the feature base and exploring potential values from features.

  abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications involve real-time monitoring, detection, and data analysis. However, the intermittent activity of IIoT devices and limited battery capacity pose critical challenges. This paper addresses these interconnected issues, focusing on extending the battery life of IIoT devices sensing events/alarms by minimizing the number of unnecessary transmissions. We propose a threshold-based transmission-decision policy based on the sensing quality and the network spatial deployment. We optimize the transmission thresholds using several approaches such as successive convex approximation, block coordinate descent methods, Voronoi diagrams, explainable machine learning, algorithms based on natural selection and social behavior, and Q-learning. Through numerical evaluation, we demonstrate significant performance enhancements in low-power IIoT environments, with Q-learning performing the best, while the block coordinate descending method performs the worst. We compare the proposed methods to a benchmark that assigns the same transmission threshold to all devices. In low-density scenarios, all proposed methods outperform the benchmark, while in high-density scenarios, only Voronoi-(i), K-nearest neighbors, and Q-learning show better performance. Power consumption is reduced by up to 95% in low-density scenarios compared to the benchmark and by 63% in high-density scenarios.},

  title={An Optimized Genetic Algorithm-based BP Neural Network Model for the Classification of Human Pre-miRNA Subclasses}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1102-1109},
  abstract={Pre-miRNAs, as the precursor forms of miRNAs, possess significant research potential due to their intricate structural features. Accurate classification of pre-miRNAs is crucial for comprehending their roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation processes. This paper focuses on two distinct subclasses of pre-miRNAs: canonical miRNAs and mirtrons. Canonical miRNAs exhibit high conservation across species, whereas mirtrons display species-specific roles and expression patterns. To address the classification task, our study employed a Backward Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model. While BPNN is renowned for its ability to learn and adapt from non-linear data, it often encounters challenges when dealing with high-dimensional spaces, leading to local optima. To further enhance the BPNN model, our study integrated BPNN with Genetic Algorithm (GA), a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. GA is adept at exploring large and complex search spaces, which helps find alternative weight parameters for the BPNN model and thus enhances the model's convergence capability. The original dataset utilized in this study consists of human pre-miRNA sequences accompanied by accurately annotated class labels, sourced from miRBase (v21). A set of 25 features was derived from the original dataset, out of which 10 features were selected using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique as the independent variables. GA-BPNN's model performance was evaluated using independent testing datasets split from the pre-processed dataset and compared with other common Machine Learning (ML) techniques, demonstrating improved prediction performances for pre-miRNAs.},

  year={2025},

  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Dynamic fuzzy broad learning system (DFBLS) is a fuzzy neural network based on the TSK fuzzy system and broad learning (BL). DFBLS possesses excellent model interpretability and efficient predictive performance. However, due to the phenomenon of rule explosion and the redundancy of network nodes, balancing network structure and performance has become a challenge in the construction of the DFBLS. Therefore, for the best balance between model predictive performance and network simplicity, a fuzzy broad neuroevolutionary network via multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) was developed in this article. First, an effective genetic encoding strategy was designed to represent the feature node building blocks and network connectivity relationships. The incremental mechanism and the randomly connected network relationships in the ILFR structure are replaced by the evolutionary framework. Second, a multiobjective optimization problem model is constructed with the optimization objectives of prediction performance and minimal network structure, and the corresponding objective functions are proposed. Finally, a self-adaptive mutation strategy with scaling genes is proposed for NSGA-II to optimize the accuracy and structure of the neural networks. The experiments demonstrate that SGNSGA-DFBLS achieves the best hypervolume (HV) values in 7 out of 9 public datasets. Its performance on the Air and pm2.5 datasets is either superior to or on par with other recently proposed models. SGNSGA-DFBLS can achieve high test accuracy with fewer fuzzy rules (FRs) and a compact network structure when constructing fuzzy broad network models.},

Robust medicine recommendation systems are needed to provide timely and accurate drug recommendations, improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare utilization. This research paper aims to propose a recommendation system for medical drugs that utilize sentiment analysis and captures main features using CRNN with a self-attention mechanism. This self-attention was instrumental in enabling the system to concentrate on critical segments of the text, while the CRNN architecture facilitated the capture of both spatial and temporal features of the input. The system yielded 96% accuracy, alongside precision, recall, and F1 scores of 95.4%, 93.8%, and 94.6%, surpassing multiple baseline models and hybrid models in recommending top drugs accurately for particular conditions. Hence, by providing efficient and effective drug recommendations, the proposed system can significantly benefit medical professionals and patients, particularly those in underserved communities.},

  abstract={Pathogen control is a critical aspect of modern poultry farming, providing important benefits for both public health and productivity. Effective poultry management measures to reduce pathogen levels in poultry flocks promote food safety by lowering risks of food-borne illnesses. They also support animal health and welfare by preventing infectious diseases that can rapidly spread and impact flock growth, egg production, and overall health. This study frames the search for optimal management practices that minimize the presence of multiple pathogens as a combinatorial optimization problem. Specifically, we model the various possible combinations of management settings as a solution space that can be efficiently explored to identify configurations that optimally reduce pathogen levels. This design incorporates a neural network feedback-based method that combines feature explanations with global sensitivity analysis to ensure combinatorial optimization in multiobjective settings. Our preliminary experiments have promising results when applied to two real-world agricultural datasets. While further validation is still needed, these early experimental findings demonstrate the potential of the model to derive targeted feature interactions that adaptively optimize pathogen control under varying real-world constraints.},

  abstract={Rule-based machine learning (RBML) models are often presumed to be very beneficial for tasks where explainabil-ity of machine learning models is considered essential. However, their models are only really explainable as long as their rule sets are compact. This leads to the need for an optimizer to take prediction error and rule count as objectives. Given the highly complex fitness landscape of rule set learning tasks, good hyperparameters of the optimizer as well as their robustness against local minima is detrimental. In this paper, we explore the use of four self-adaptive genetic algorithms (SAGAs) for the optimization of a recent evolutionary RBML system to reduce the number of hyperparameters to tune and hopefully find better minima. To evaluate the advantages, we benchmark against a non-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) on five real-world data sets. We find-with the support of a rigorous statistical analysis-that some of the SAGAs deliver a suitable alternative, which is easier to handle for non-experts in GA configurations. This is crucial for a wider application of this RBML method.},

  abstract={Mimicking the biological visual attention mechanism to detect salient objects in images has been widely studied in recent years. Most of the existing computational models rely on external learning for saliency prediction, which however lack robustness in diversified scenes. In this paper, an unsupervised learning model is proposed to detect salient objects by fully exploiting the internal information of the scene. Specifically, we formulate saliency detection as a mathematical programming problem with which to learn a nonlinear feature mapping from multi-view features to saliency scores. The optimization objective is to maximize the between-class variance of the attended and background regions in the resulting saliency maps, which is statistically optimal. Moreover, to solve the non-convex constrained mathematical programming problem, a hybrid external point method based particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution in a rapid manner. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four classical saliency benchmark datasets to test the effectiveness of the proposed method and it shows superior qualitative and quantitative performance than the other 16 state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency models.},

  abstract={To address the issues of low accuracy, poor interpretability, and over-reliance on data in conventional model-based and data-based methods for pipeline leakage detection (PLD), an integrated model-driven and data-driven approach is proposed in this paper. In the presented method, the particle swarm optimised radial basis function (PSO-RBF) neural network is introduced into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the pipeline. Such the hybrid model improves the accuracy of the pipeline description by employing PSO-RBF to compensate for the errors generated by the model-based approach due to inaccurate meshing and imprecise modeling. The CFD model for the natural gas pipeline is initially built using the Ansys Fluent platform for offline training. It is then integrated with the PSO-RBF model. In the online detection stage, the trained CFD-PSO-RBF model is utilized for online prediction and real-time monitoring of pipeline operation. To demonstrate the application potential of the developed method, it is successfully employed to detect natural gas leakage in a laboratory simulating a real natural gas pipeline. Experimental results show that, in comparison to the traditional methods, the CFD-PSO-RBF method improves the accuracy of leakage detection and performs well in terms of response time.},

  abstract={Explanation supervision is a technique in which the model is guided by human-generated explanations during training. This technique aims to improve the predictability of the model by incorporating human understanding of the prediction process into the training phase. This is a challenging task since it relies on the accuracy of human annotation labels. To obtain high-quality explanation annotations, using multiple annotations to do explanation supervision is a reasonable method. However, how to use multiple annotations to improve accuracy is particularly challenging due to the following: 1) The noisiness of annotations from different annotators; 2) The lack of pre-given information about the corresponding relationship between annotations and annotators; 3) Missing annotations since some images are not labeled by all annotators. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-annotated explanation-guided learning (MAGI) framework to do explanation supervision with comprehensive and high-quality generated annotations. We first propose a novel generative model to generate annotations from all annotators and infer them using a newly proposed variational inference-based technique by learning the characteristics of each annotator. We also incorporate an alignment mechanism into the generative model to infer the correspondence between annotations and annotators in the training process. Extensive experiments on two datasets from the medical imaging domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in handling noisy annotations while obtaining superior prediction performance compared with previous SOTA.},

  pages={65997-66008},
  abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning approach combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks and an attention mechanism to extract sentiment and thematic content from literary texts. The model is designed to capture complex emotional nuances and themes in literature by processing text data from both forward and backward directions, while the attention mechanism enables the model to focus on the most important sections of the text. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm to fine-tune the model for efficient sentiment extraction. A case study using a dataset of 500 English novels spanning various genres demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The model achieved high accuracy and F1 scores in sentiment classification and thematic extraction, outperforming traditional methods like CNNs. The analysis revealed key emotional themes such as joy, fear, and sorrow, and the thematic content included love, betrayal, and revenge. The results highlight the potential of deep learning to advance literary analysis by providing deeper insights into both emotional and thematic layers of literary works. Future directions include exploring multimodal data integration and expanding the application of deep learning in the humanities.},

  abstract={Cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke are among the most common causes of death and disability worldwide and are preventable and treatable. Early detection of strokes and their rapid intervention play an important role in reducing the burden of disease and improving clinical outcomes. In recent years, machine learning methods have attracted a lot of attention as they can be used to detect strokes. The aim of this study is to identify reliable methods, algorithms, and features that help medical professionals make informed decisions about stroke treatment and prevention. To achieve this goal, we have developed an early stroke detection system based on CT images of the brain coupled with a genetic algorithm and a bidirectional long short-term Memory (BiLSTM) to detect strokes at a very early stage. For image classification, a genetic approach based on neural networks is used to select the most relevant features for classification. The BiLSTM model is then fed with these features. Cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic system, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), and AUC (Area Under The Curve). All of these metrics were used to determine the system’s overall effectiveness. The proposed diagnostic system achieved an accuracy of 96.5%. We also compared the performance of the proposed model with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. With the proposed diagnosis system, physicians can make an informed decision about stroke.},

  abstract={Retaining customers is of great importance for all subscription-based financial institutions. Having in mind that even a small change in customer churn can have a significant impact on a company's profits and overall value of the company, proper customer churn management is a prerequisite. When it comes to banks, the key issue is identifying reasons (factors) that lead to contract termination between a customer and a bank. This paper offers a new model for forecasting customer churn and determines the contribution of variables that could lead to losing a customer. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence approach for predicting churn using the XGboost methods. A novel metaheuristic algorithm is proposed and tasked with se-lecting optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost algorithm. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on real-world data and compared to several cutting-edge algorithms, attaining the best performance, with the highest accuracy of approximately 97%, which proves presumption that customer credit card churn could be forecast with high precision. Additionally, the best models have been subjected to SHAP analysis to determine feature impact. Attained results show that features that belong to customer account information have the strongest impact on customer turnover, while personal customer information does not have or has little contribution. Features with the highest SHAP values are total transaction count and amount over the last 12 months and total revolving card balance.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular across a wide range of applications, but recent research has revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor attack methods often involve complex computational costs, making them less practical in real-world scenarios. Data augmentation, a commonly used technique for improving model generalization, offers an ideal source for trigger generation due to its low computational overhead and the fact that the generated images do not raise suspicion. However, current backdoor attack strategies that employ data augmentation typically rely on randomly selected augmentation techniques, which yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose BGD3A, a novel backdoor attack method driven by a genetic algorithm, optimizing the selection of data augmentation combinations. Attackers can customize the fitness function to generate an optimal combination of augmentation techniques to meet their objectives. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BGD3A not only achieves high attack success rates but also remains robust against state-of-the-art backdoor defense mechanisms.},

  abstract={The widespread use of machine learning (ML) in software engineering (SE) encounters a notable challenge: the need for various domain-specific parameters in algorithms. The issue arises when attempting to reuse these parameters across different applications, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes. This hindrance significantly contributes to the limited migration of ML solutions from research labs to industrial settings. This paper underscores the pressing need for novel research to tackle the overarching problem of generic algorithm customisation. To address this, we propose leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches. These techniques automatically select intelligible models and their corresponding hyper-parameters for forecasting software defect-proneness. More specifically, this paper adapts an AutoML approach to the field of software defect prediction, namely a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for automatically designing decision tree algorithms (HEAD-DT), originally proposed to address a generic optimisation problem. We benchmark against the popular general software defect-proneness prediction framework (GSDP) and some standard classifiers. Experimental results reveal that the proposed HEAD-DT implementation surpasses other algorithms across three distinct evaluation measures.},

  abstract={The effectiveness of Physical Education (PE) teaching based on Deep Learning (DL) aims to maximum college students by addressing current deficiencies in college teachers' teaching abilities. However, PE teachers often lack experience and struggle with handling the high computational load, which affects accuracy. This paper proposes using the Levy Flight Mother Optimization Algorithm (LFMOA) method for feature selection and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification to efficiently achieve high accuracy. Initially, the COCO dataset for physical activity is obtained and pre-processed using normalization to scale the data. Feature selection using LFMOA is performed to choose relevant features and handle high dimensionality. The CNN classification is then performed on large data set to enhance accuracy of PE teaching evaluation model, allowing users to select a model that balances performance. Although the proposed LFMOA-CNN technique exhibits higher performance compared to existing methods such as Genetic Algorithm - Back Propagation (GA-BP) and U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), performance of proposed method achieves a high accuracy of 0.99, respectively.},

  year={2024},

  number={},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={Feature construction has shown promise in improving the accuracy of crop classification by constructing high-level features. However, current feature construction methods often rely on domain knowledge and have a limited interpretability of the solutions. To address this, this study proposes a new genetic programming (GP) approach to automatically evolve solutions with high interpretability that can construct high-level features for crop classification from hyperspectral images. A flexible representation of multiple trees is proposed in the proposed GP approach to construct various types of high-level features from the original ones, simultaneously. To improve the search ability, a new offspring generation method is developed to dynamically guide the evolution of the population while improving the diversity of the population. The new approach wraps with three classification algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), for crop classification on three datasets with different difficulties and tasks. The results demonstrate that the features constructed by the new approach can effectively distinguish different crop categories. The new approach achieves better performance than the compared GP-based method, classic methods, and deep learning methods in crop classification using hyperspectral images. Importantly, the proposed approach shows the high interpretability of the constructed features.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of deep neural networks in machine learning calls for an objective quantification of esoteric trust. In this paper we propose GradTrust, a classification trust measure for large-scale neural networks at inference. The proposed method utilizes variance of counterfactual gradients, i.e. the required changes in the network parameters if the label were different. We show that GradTrust is superior to existing techniques for detecting misprediction rates on 50000 images from ImageNet validation dataset. Depending on the network, GradTrust detects images where either the ground truth is incorrect or ambiguous, or the classes are co-occurring. We extend GradTrust to Video Action Recognition on Kinetics-400 dataset. We showcase results on 14 architectures pretrained on ImageNet and 5 architectures pretrained on Kinetics-400. We observe the following: (i) simple methodologies like negative log likelihood and margin classifiers outperform state-of-the-art uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection techniques for misprediction rates, and (ii) the proposed GradTrust is in the Top-2 performing methods on 37 of the considered 38 experimental modalities.

  abstract={This work evaluates the performance of four machine learning models (MLMs): support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), discriminant analysis (DA), and logistic regression (LR) in predicting the biodegradability of chemicals, a critical factor for assessing environmental risks. For this purpose, the RDKit library was initially employed to extract nine fingerprints from a dataset consisting of 1717 chemical compounds. Subsequently, the Information Gain (IG) feature ranking algorithm was used to identify the top 100 predictive features for each fingerprint. The MLM Hyperparameters were optimized, and informative features were selected using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), which identified dominant pairs (MLM/fingerprint) maximizing F1-score while minimizing number of features. MACCS, Layered, and Avalon molecular fingerprints associated with the different MLM showed superior performance, with KNN/MACCS achieving a cross-validated F1-score of 87.63% using only 13 features. Afterwards, the final classification models were constructed using the solution with the highest cross-validated F1-score complement for each combination of MLM/fingerprint. These models were then evaluated on both the training and test datasets. In the training subset, the MACCS fingerprint consistently outperformed others, achieving cross-validated AUC scores above 90% for all models (SVM: 91%, KNN: 90.4%, DA: 90.9%, LR: 91.32%). The SVM/MACCS pair demonstrated the highest accuracy (94.17%), specificity (95.84%), and F1-score (93.14%). In the test subset, the SVM/Layered pair exhibited the highest accuracy (84.01%) and specificity (88.09%). The DA/Avalon combination achieved the highest sensitivity (84.40%), while the SVM/Avalon pair reached the highest F1-score (82.58%). These results underscore the effectiveness of MACCS fingerprints for biodegradation classification across various models. Additionally, Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) have identified the key MACCS features influencing biodegradation classifications in the SVM model. These methods highlighted MACCS bit numbers 154, 145, 142, 144, and 156 as the most crucial contributors to the SVM model’s predictions.},

  abstract={Deep Learning (DL) models for automatic ECG interpretation became widely investigated in recent years. However, their performance varies highly across models and datasets. One of the main reasons is the possibility that the DL model might learn spurious correlations present in a dataset between inputs and outcomes. In this study, we proposed a novel training strategy potentially able to force the domain knowledge into a DL model, by complementing, only during training, an end-to-end approach with features known to be relevant for the outcome. We tested the approach for the creation of a DL model tuned to identify myocardial infarction (MI)from the standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). Two models were trained: one with standard backpropagation (full model) and the second one (split model) with the proposed approach, on the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. An explainable AI technique was then used to identify which ECG leads were considered relevant by both models for each MI site, and were compared with guidelines for MI site identification. The validation accuracy was 0.85 and 0.69 for full and split models, respectively. Despite the lower performance achieved with the proposed approach, the number of relevant leads was higher (10 vs 4), suggesting that the domain knowledge was likely percolated into the DL model, made it more robust and capable of better generalization on other dataset.},

  abstract={In the process of production, automobile steel forgings are prone to various cracks, which affect the product quality. At present, forgings defects are mainly detected by fluorescent magnetic particle inspection and manual inspection. Aiming at the problems of low detection accuracy and efficiency in this method, an improved convolutional neural network model is proposed. The fluorescent magnetic particle inspection images of two typical forgings were intelligently inspected. Firstly, a deep learning model with EfficientNet as the backbone and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as the fusion layer is constructed. Secondly, in order to improve the convergence speed and detection accuracy, the calculation method of intersection over union is improved, and the network is improved by using the Attention Mechanism. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) with adaptive parameters is introduced to optimize the hyperparameters of neural network, and a fluorescent magnetic particle inspection image acquisition platform is built for verification. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of the best model of EfficientNet-PSO on the validation set is 95.69%. F1 score is 0.94 and FLOPs is 1.86B. Compared with other five deep learning neural network models, this method effectively improves the defect detection efficiency and accuracy of flange plate and cylinder head, which can meet the defect detection requirements.},

  abstract={This article proposes a new multiobjective optimization approach for designing a self-generated interpretable fuzzy logic system (FLS). The types of fuzzy sets (FSs) can be constructed automatically by self-organizing method, so as to form a hybrid fuzzy system. Different from the existing evolutionary type-1 fuzzy system, which is full of type-1 FSs, and the evolutionary interval type-2 fuzzy system, which is full of interval type-2 FSs, there are both type-1 FSs and interval type-2 FSs in the hybrid fuzzy system. A new transparency-oriented objective function is defined, and the constraint of the footprint of uncertainty of the interval type-2 (IT2) FS is considered for the first time. A new FS merging criterion focusing on the proximity of the cores of FSs is proposed, which is easy to calculate and maintains the characteristics of classical similarity measures. Combined with the new merging criterion, the online cluster and FS updating algorithm is employed to initialize the reference rule base and the type of FS, as it is assumed that no training data are collected in advance. Based on the reference rule base, the advanced multiobjective front-guided continuous ant colony optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize all the free parameters of the FLS. With the operation mentioned above, the self-generated FLSs achieve a good balance between interpretability and performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by three nonlinear system tracking problems.},

  abstract={Object detection and recognition have emerged as crucial research areas, driven by the dire need to address the challenges posed by identifying and recognizing objects in diverse domains. Accurate object identification and recognition is required for tasks such as autonomous navigation, video surveillance, precision agriculture, and medical imaging. We propose a method based on a unique combination of machine learning techniques for object recognition. The proposed approach starts by applying K-means segmentation to the input image to cluster similar regions and colors. Next, a composite saliency map is generated based on the K-means segmentation output. Subsequently, the technique of extracting objects from the saliency map is accomplished through the employment of the connected pixel object extraction method. Ultimately, the Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize decision tree classifier for the purpose of object recognition. The MSRC dataset was utilized to assess the proposed approach, resulting in an accuracy of 81.5%, accompanied by a precision of 83.3% and recall of 86.1%.

  abstract={The identification of dynamic models for ships is essential in marine and maritime engineering, as it facilitates accurate prediction and control of vessel behavior. Traditional ship system identification methods involve identifying a few parameters from the dynamic model. Only simplified linearized models have utilized metaheuristic techniques for ship identification recently. This paper describes a new way to use the Artificial Protozoa Optimization (APO) algorithm to make an Autoregression with Exogenous Input (ARX) model for the full ship dynamics work better. The adaptive foraging, dormancy, and reproduction behaviors of protozoa gave rise to the APO algorithm, which is a strong metaheuristic framework for parameter optimization. By leveraging the APO, we aim to enhance the accuracy of ship dynamics identification and its explainability. Evaluation of the model on the provided test data demonstrates that the APO-optimized ARX model provides excellent identification compared to results from existing methods, achieving a mean R2 score of 0.9437, thus providing a reliable and efficient tool for ship maneuvering identification.},

  abstract={The shift towards renewable sources of power has brought several associated challenges. The sporadic nature of power generation, high reliance on weather, and difficulties with long-term storage are just some of the challenges facing large-scale adoption. Storage is especially challenging due to the large associated upfront costs of batteries coupled with limited lifetimes further shortened by uneven charging. One possible step for improving the adoption of renewable sources is to develop robust techniques for forecasting power generation to better plan power demands. This work proposed an approach based on time series forecasting through the use of recurrent neural networks augmented with an attention mechanism. To further optimize the performance of this approach a modified version of a well-known metaheuristic algorithm is also introduced. The proposed approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset consisting of weather and wind farm power generation data from a wind farm located in mainland China. Several metaheuristics have been applied to optimize the proposed approach and the outcomes have been subjected to a comparative analysis to determine the best approach.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis has illuminated brain network interactions across many neuropsychiatric disorders. A common analysis approach involves using hard clustering methods to identify transitory states of brain activity, and in response to this, other methods have been developed to quantify the importance of specific dFNC interactions to identified states. Some of these methods involve perturbing individual features and examining the number of samples that switch states. However, only a minority of samples switch states. As such, these methods actually identify the importance of dFNC features to the clustering of a subset of samples rather than the overall clustering. In this study, we present a novel approach that more capably identifies the importance of each feature to the overall clustering. Our approach uses fuzzy clustering to output probabilities of each sample belonging to states and then measures their Kullback-Leibler divergence after perturbation. We show the viability of our approach in the context of schizophrenia (SZ) default mode network analysis, identifying significant differences in state dynamics between individuals with SZ and healthy controls. We further compare our approach with an existing approach, showing that it captures the effects of perturbation upon most samples. We also find that interactions between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the anterior cingulate cortex and the PCC and precuneus are important across methods. We expect that our novel explainable clustering approach will enable further progress in rs-fMRI analysis and to other clustering applications.},

  abstract={Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for code generation has greatly enhanced software development. However, despite the advances in automated code generation frameworks that incorporate self-repair strategies, successful outcomes are not always guaranteed. This led us to explore a different approach to improving code quality. So we implemented a brainstorm-select-repair framework. For a natural language query, our framework first generates multiple foundational code snippets. Then these snippets are tested on test cases, and a text-similarity-based algorithm is used to identify the most accurate code. If none of the generated code snippets successfully fulfills the test cases, our proposed self-repair strategy is used to rectify any flawed code snippets until a code snippet that can pass the test case is identified and then provided to the user. Based on ChatGPT3, our framework reached 89% Pass@1 on HumanEval dataset (at least 3% higher than ChatGPT-4 the best model to date on this dataset). Our framework also surpasses state-of-the-art methods and delivers superior performance on the HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET datasets. To further validate our design rationale, we conducted comprehensive experiments and analyzed the impact of each component.},

  abstract={In the field of machining, product quality must meet customer specifications. In general, surface roughness is an essential indicator of machining quality. Low surface roughness correlates with increased fatigue strength and corrosion resistance. However, the main factor that affects surface roughness is the selection of the machining parameters. When different parameters are combined, the resulting machining quality varies. Therefore, to achieve the desired machining quality, appropriate machining parameters must be selected. In this study, an ultrasonic-assisted machining system (UAMS) was designed to help users determine the machining parameters and machine SiC materials. To establish a prediction model for surface roughness, a novel network mapping fusion (NMF) convolutional neuro-fuzzy network (CNFN) model was used in the designed UAMS. The differential evolution algorithm was then used to search for optimized machining parameters. To explain the prediction model, which can help analyze the factors that have the greatest influence on surface roughness, a Shapley additive explanations method is proposed. The proposed NMF–CNFN model was more accurate than were the other deep learning models and exhibited a MAPE of 1.98%. When optimized machining parameters were selected, the desired surface roughness was obtained, thereby confirming the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed UAMS. Moreover, the proposed model was implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to reduce its power consumption and increase its computational performance. Experimental results indicated that the computational speed of the FPGA was 99.64% and 99.16% higher than those of the CPU and GPU, respectively.},

  year={2025},

  pages={258-273},
  abstract={IPv6 covert channels have emerged as a novel type of network threat, which poses new challenges to network security. Multi-field covert channels make use of distributed embedding technology to scatter covert information across multiple packet fields. Existing deep learning-based methods for detecting IPv6 covert channels primarily focus on detecting of single-field covert channels, limiting their capability to detect multi-field covert channels and thereby restricting their applicability in large-scale distributed network environments. Furthermore, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on detecting covert channels that embed secret information within the IPv6 header, while overlooking the potential covert channels present within the IPv6 extension headers. To address these issues, we propose a model for detecting IPv6 multi-field covert channels based on self-attention mechanism, which utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to aggregate input data, compute correlation scores between different subfields, and then weight-average the subfields to detect and locate covert channels. Our model is evaluated on the IPv6 covert channel dataset, and the results demonstrate its capability to detect multi-field covert channels constructed using both the IPv6 header and IPv6 extension headers, encompassing a total of 23 detection types. Compared to BNS-CNN and DICCh-D, the detectable fields have been increased by 2.5 times. Additionally, our model demonstrates significant precision (97.13%) and a low false positive rate (6.3%) in detecting and locating multiple scenarios.},

It is planned to classify ECG signals into five cardiac types, including, the Normal class (N), Paced class (P), Left Bundle Branch Block class (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block class (RBBB) and Premature Ventricular Contraction class (PVC). The main purpose deals with the optimization of a fuzzy system. In fact, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied mainly for tuning the membership and rules parameters. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is considered as the cost function. Accordingly, the investigated approach presents efficient accuracy (RMSE = 0.398) when the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is of TakagiSugeno (TS) type and the Gaussian membership is selected. The good linguistic interpretation is the power of GeneticFuzzy hybrid approach regarding others in machine learning.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={In multiobjective feature selection, different feature subsets with the same number of selected features can achieve identical classification accuracy, meaning that it is a multimodal optimization problem. To effectively search for multimodal feature subsets within the vast search spaces of high-dimensional datasets, it is crucial to adopt reasonable encoding and search methods. Generally, applying a uniform evolutionary operator based on a single encoding method across the entire feature space is inefficient and prone to falling into local optima. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal multiobjective feature selection method based on a joint encoding mechanism that combines discrete encoding and continuous encoding. It provides new perspectives to solve the high-dimensional feature selection problem from encoding methods to search operators. First, the search space is divided into a discrete encoding region and a continuous encoding region based on the knee points of feature importance ranking curve. A tailored initialization strategy is used to obtain the initial population for joint encoding. Second, an adaptive niche strategy based on three priorities is proposed, which ensures the similarity of individuals within a niche and the difference between niches. In addition, different search operators are cooperated with the two encoding strategies respectively to achieve effective and efficient search. The experimental results on 24 datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better classification performance than the state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

This paper proposes an optimal deployment algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on reverse node selection and graph attention mechanism. By assessing the similarity between the newly generated graph topology of the sensor network and that of the unoptimized one, the algorithm adeptly identifies redundant sensor nodes and puts them to sleep. This meticulous process ensures the optimal deployment of wireless sensor network. In the graph similarity comparison stage, a graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the attention weights of nodes and compute the graph embedding, aiming to obtain a more accurate expression of graph similarity. The experiment is conducted on China's Ground-Based Basic Meteorological Observation Sensor Network (CGBMOSN). The results demonstrate that the algorithm can capture up to 95 percent of the complete sensor network information with only 60 percent of nodes.},

  abstract={Point cloud registration is an important task for other point cloud tasks. Feature-based methods are widely adopted for their speed and efficiency in point cloud registration. The descriptive capability of features extracted by a single geometric descriptor is limited. Descriptive capabilities can be improved by concatenating features extracted from multiple descriptors. However, due to the existence of redundant and irrelevant features, the correct corresponding points are difficult to match, which further affects the registration effect. We propose an evolutionary multitasking point cloud descriptor optimization method. Integrate existing descriptors to optimize descriptors with stronger description ability. Labeling features to calculate the feature importance for the registration and generating multitasks. In optimized processing, approximate evaluation which is calculated by prior correspondence saved in the database replaces the expensive searching correspondences process in the entire point cloud. Finally, a multiscale filter is developed to remove error correspondences by the geometric information from multiple scale descriptor features. Experimental demonstrate that the proposed approach can optimize a feature subset with higher descriptive capability compared to other methods and show superior point cloud registration performance on 14 point cloud models. This is the first paper on point cloud descriptor optimization, which provides a new idea for point cloud registration research.},

  abstract={Road traffic accidents, primarily caused by driver-related issues such as stress, result in numerous fatalities and injuries. Effective prediction of driver stress within the driving phase is paramount for real-time accident intervention, while it requires prediction accuracy, stability, and enough predictive lead time. Physiological data contains rich information related to driver stress levels, which can be captured by machine learning models. However, those models are mainly developed for and perform well in static stress detection tasks, not addressing practical requirements of predictive lead time and performance stability. This study introduces a novel approach, the GP-CNN-LSTM model, Which employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Genetic Programming (GP), leverages GP to explore the feature space upon physiological sensor signals, and relies on CNN-LSTM to predict driver stress. Experiments show that this model achieves high accuracy for a 60-second forward stress prediction, with more stability compared to Fractional Fourier Transform-based benchmark models. We found explainable effective signals and features described by math functions via genetic programming that helped in improving the accuracy and stability of driver stress prediction.},

  abstract={This paper presents an experimental study that compares the performance of four selected metaheuristic algorithms for optimizing a time delay system model. Time delay system models are complex and challenging to optimize due to their inherent characteristics, such as non-linearity, multi-modality, and constraints. The study includes an explanation of the choice and core functionality of the selected algorithms, which are both baseline and state-of-the-art variants of self-organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA), state-of-the-art variant from the Success-History-based Adaptive Differential Evolution family of algorithms, with emphasis on diverse search (DISH algorithm), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The hyperparameters of the metaheuristic algorithms were set using the iRace automatic algorithm configuration framework. The paper emphasizes the importance of metaheuristic algorithms in control engineering for time-delay systems to develop more effective and efficient control strategies and precise model identifications. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art algorithms with specific adaptive mechanisms like population organization process, diverse search and adaptation mechanisms ensuring a gradual transition from exploration to exploitation. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the challenges and advantages of using metaheuristic algorithms in control engineering for time delay systems. The results provide valuable insights into the performance of modern metaheuristic algorithms and can help guide the selection of appropriate adaptive mechanisms of metaheuristics.},

  abstract={Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a promising paradigm in the field of node representation learning, owing to their capacity to capture both node features and their relationships. However, GNNs could suffer from algorithmic discrimination in the context of high-stakes applications. To facilitate the algorithmic fairness of GNNs, several studies have been proposed for fair GNNs. However, a primary issue of fair GNNs is that ensuring algorithmic fairness could impair the node classification performance. In order to better balance algorithmic fairness and node classification performance, this work presents a mutual information-based counterfactual generation algorithm for fair GNNs. Specifically, the counterfactuals of the graph data are generated by a fairness adversarial loss, thus guiding the GNNs towards fair ones. Meanwhile, a mutual information-based mechanism is designed to minimize the discrepancy between the representations from the original graph and the counterfactuals, thus maintaining the node classification performance. Extensive experimental studies have been performed on three graph datasets to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the rapid growth of university-industry collaborations has created a demanding need for a comprehensive and data-driven evaluation framework. However, the existing Clustering Analysis Method (CAM) was heavily depended on the quality of data which led to lacking in scalability. Hence, this research proposes a Shapley Additive exPlanation with Variational Autoencoders (SHAP-VAE) to increase the scalability by evaluating the quality of university-industry education integration. This process begins with the collection of input data from Spanish university student data. Then, the development of measurement scales is done through Service Quality (SERVQUAL) scale consists of 5 dimensions which specifies the students’ academic characteristics to evaluate the student’s performance. After that, SHAP is employed to select the features by sorting the average Shapley values in descending order. Finally, VAE is introduced to evaluate the quality of teaching and student performance by identifying the latent factors that influence education quality. From the results, the proposed SHAP-VAE provided better results in terms of Goodness of Fitness (GoF) with 95% when compared to existing Genetic Algorithm based Quality Evaluation method for College Teaching model Reform (GAQECTR).},

  abstract={Large language models have been shown to be useful in multiple domains including conversational agents, education, and explainable AI. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI as a conversational agent. ChatGPT was trained on data generated by humans and by receiving human feedback. This training process results in a bias toward humans’ traits and preferences. In this paper, we stress multiple biases of ChatGPT, and show that its responses demonstrate many human traits. We begin by showing a very high correlation between the frequency of digits generated by ChatGPT and humans’ favorite numbers, with the most frequent digit generated by ChatGPT, matching humans’ most favorable number, 7. We continue by showing that ChatGPT’s responses in several social experiments are much closer to those of humans’ than to those of fully rational agents. Finally, we show that several cognitive biases, known in humans, are also present in ChatGPT’s responses.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problems of insufficient feature discrimination, difficulty in parameter adjustment, and lack of time dependence capture ability in the existing credit risk prediction models of listed companies, this paper proposes a PSOCNN-BiLSTM-MQA credit risk prediction method PCBM based on hierarchical feature modeling. Based on the financial data of listed companies in Guotai’an database, the method divides the data into four types of first-level characteristics: debt paying ability, operating ability, profitability and development ability. Each class of first-level features is further subdivided into several second-level features. In the feature extraction stage, a twochannel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to extract the local features of each class of level-1 features. One channel processed the original data, and the other channel processed the features converted to grayscale images. After being processed by different CNNS, the multi-query attention mechanism (MQA) was used to fuse the features from different channels to enhance the attention to features at different levels. At the same time, the bidirectional long short-term memory network is used to capture the long-term dependencies in the time series data, and the fused features are integrated through the MQA mechanism. In order to further improve the performance of the model, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the model parameters. Experimental results show that compared with the existing prediction models, the PCBM model shows significant improvement in accuracy, precision, recall rate and F1-score, which proves the effectiveness of this method in the credit risk prediction of listed companies.},

  abstract={Computational speaker separation, or multi-talker separation, attempts to use neural network models to separate a stream containing multiple speakers into an individual stream for each speaker. Such separation has advantages in many situations, for example, an emergency 911 call may contain multiple people talking simultaneously; in a call-center scenario, the agent may be presented with an audio stream that contains a customer speaking while a television is playing in the background; interviews and political debates often consist of speakers talking over each other. In all of these cases, separating the mixed stream into individual streams enables back-end processes to detect which particular stream is of importance, and provides for greater conversational intelligence from the separated streams when compared to the mixed stream. In this paper, we examine which features are important to the speaker separation problem; we comprehensively examine 14 characteristic features of a mixed audio stream to determine the subset of features that lead to a cleaner separation. Our key results are that four features, namely minimum intensity, minimum pitch, difference in intensity, and difference in pitch lead to superior speaker separation. By providing significant evidence into the relationship between input audio features and separation efficacy, this work contributes towards optimizing novel strategies for speaker separation systems.},

To solve these problems, we propose a novel ensemble prediction model based on genetic algorithm. Specifically, we screen out three high-accuracy models and key feature subsets through genetic algorithm, then fuse the three models through integration algorithm and genetic algorithm, and finally make predictions through voting mechanism. Our model improves by 20.1% compared to the baselines and explains the key features.},

  abstract={Accurate assessment of biochemical compositions in fish products is essential for quality control in the seafood industry and nutritional research. While spectroscopic techniques enable non-destructive analysis, each method has limitations in prediction accuracy and reliability. Multi-modal data fusion offers a promising solution, but developing robust fusion strategies remains challenging due to complex relationships between spectral features and biochemical properties. This paper presents GP-Fusion, a genetic programming-based high-level fusion method that integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities. Unlike conventional approaches, GPFusion evolves interpretable fusion functions to optimize predictions from diverse spectroscopy work-flows. A key innovation is the replicate variance penalty, which enhances prediction consistency across replicate measurements by capturing within-sample variability and mitigating batch effects. Experimental evaluations on three biochemical targets, including Omega-3, Omega-6, and monounsaturated fatty acids, show that GPFusion improves the coefficient of determination by 6.9%, 8.0%, and 2.6%, respectively. Compared with other high-level fusion strategies, GPFusion delivers more stable predictions with lower variance while maintaining competitive accuracy. Additional empirical studies confirms the effectiveness of the replicate variance penalty and reveal critical trade-offs between tree depth and terminal flexibility for evolving compact and interpretable fusion functions.},

  abstract={The fuzzy logic-based neural network usually forms fuzzy rules via multiplying the input membership degrees, which lacks expressiveness and flexibility. In this article, a novel neural network model is designed by integrating the gene expression programming into the interval type-2 fuzzy rough neural network, aiming to generate fuzzy rules with more expressiveness utilizing various logical operators. The network training is regarded as a multiobjective optimization problem through simultaneously considering network precision, explainability, and generalization. Specifically, the network complexity can be minimized to generate concise and few fuzzy rules for improving the network explainability. Inspired by the extreme learning machine and the broad learning system, an enhanced distributed parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. This evolutionary algorithm can flexibly explore the forms of fuzzy rules, and the weight refinement of the final layer can significantly improve precision and convergence by solving the pseudoinverse. Experimental results show that the proposed multiobjective evolutionary network framework is superior in both effectiveness and explainability.},

  abstract={Efficient truck dispatching is crucial for optimizing container terminal operations within dynamic and complex scenarios. Despite good progress being made recently with more advanced uncertainty-handling techniques, existing approaches still have generalization issues and require considerable expertise and manual interventions in algorithm design. In this work, we present deep reinforcement learning-assisted genetic programming hyper-heuristics (DRL-GPHH) and their ensemble variant (DRL-GPEHH). These frameworks utilize a reinforcement learning agent to orchestrate a set of auto-generated genetic programming (GP) low-level heuristics, leveraging the collective intelligence, ensuring advanced robustness and an increased level of automation of the algorithm development. DRL-GPEHH, notably, excels through its concurrent integration of a GP heuristic ensemble, achieving enhanced adaptability and performance in complex, dynamic optimization tasks. This method effectively navigates traditional convergence issues of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in sparse reward and vast action spaces, while avoiding the reliance on expert-designed heuristics. It also addresses the inadequate performance of the single GP individual in varying and complex environments and preserves the inherent interpretability of the GP approach. Evaluations across various real port operational instances highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our frameworks. Essentially, innovations in DRL-GPHH and DRL-GPEHH reveal the synergistic potential of reinforcement learning and GP in dynamic truck dispatching, yielding transformative impacts on algorithm design and significantly advancing solutions to complex real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract={Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems. In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes, leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.},

  abstract={Droughts typically develop gradually, and early prediction is crucial for the government to formulate effective mitigation plans. Our approach does not involve predicting specific drought index values. Instead, we forecast whether a particular year will experience drought. Insufficient investigation has been carried out regarding variations in additional climatic indicators like shortwave radiation, wind speed, sea level, and pollution in the context of droughts in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In the study period taken from 1995 to 2020, only three years (2002, 2009, and 2017) experienced drought occurrences, resulting in an imbalanced dataset. To enhance the classification performance of this imbalanced dataset, a weighted dataset is constructed using a feature weighting approach known as the Single Objective Scorer (SOS) based Multi-objective PSO(MPSO) in conjunction with the Gradient Boosting Classifier. The proposed model facilitates objective-based multi-population formation and neighborhood learning. Precision and recall are crucial metrics, particularly in measuring imbalanced dataset classification performance. The application of multi-objective optimization techniques helps to strike a suitable balance between precision and recall. In addition to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), 14 climatic indicators based on land, atmosphere, and sea are utilized. By employing the weighted dataset created with SOS-based MPSO, a significant improvement in recall value of 0.81 is achieved. Based on the weights assigned to the features, it is identified that the Mean Sea Level of the Arabian Sea and CO2 are significant indicators for predicting meteorological drought. The Explainable AI techniques SHAP and LIME are employed for interpreting the drought prediction model, providing insights into its workings.},

  abstract={In the ever-evolving landscape of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) hardware acceleration, unlocking the true potential of systolic array accelerators has long been hindered by the daunting challenges of expertise and time investment. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automating code generation, which is key to unlocking unprecedented efficiency and performance in various domains, including hardware descriptive code. The generative power of LLMs can enable the effective utilization of preexisting designs and dedicated hardware generators. However, the successful application of LLMs to hardware accelerator design is contingent upon the availability of specialized datasets tailored for this purpose. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Systolic Array-based Accelerator DataSet (SA-DS). SA-DS comprises a diverse collection of spatial array designs following the standardized Berkeley’s Gemmini accelerator generator template, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization. SA-DS is intended to spark LLM-centered research on DNN hardware accelerator architecture.

With the objective of promoting the creation of inherently interpretable models, we present M6GP. This wrapper-based multi-objective automatic feature engineering algorithm combines key components of the M3GP and NSGA-II algorithms. Wrapping M6GP around another machine learning algorithm evolves a set of features optimized for this algorithm while potentially increasing its robustness. We compare our results with M3GP and M4GP, two ancestors from the same algorithm family, and verify that, by using a multi-objective approach, M6GP obtains equal or better results.

  abstract={Evolutionary multitasking algorithms use information exchange among individuals in a population to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously. Negative transfer is a critical factor that affects the performance of evolutionary multitasking algorithms. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate negative transfer in evolutionary multitasking algorithms. The proposed approach is grounded in rigorous theoretical analysis, which provides valuable theoretical insights into the design of an optimal linear crossover operator for mitigating negative transfer. By identifying interpretable conditions, we establish a solid theoretical foundation to prevent negative transfer in diverse scenarios. Building upon these findings, we theoretically derive a closed-form expression for the optimal crossover operator and propose practical design methods based on approximations. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed optimal crossover operator into a fundamental evolutionary multitasking algorithm framework. The resultant algorithm is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Empirical validation through comprehensive experiments confirms the effectiveness of our theoretical findings.},

  abstract={In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in the field of network security protection. With the popularization of smart terminals and the gradual increase of power grid informatization and digitization, the protection of power monitoring systems from various cybersecurity threads is a current scientific problem that needs to be solved urgently. To this end, this paper proposes a malware detection method based on genetic algorithm optimization of the CNN-SENet network, which firstly introduces the SENet attention mechanism into the convolutional neural network to enhance the spatial feature extraction capability of the model; then, the application programming interface (API) sequences corresponding to different software behaviors are processed by segmentation and de-duplication, which in turn leads to the sequence feature extraction through the CNN-SENet model; finally, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of CNN-SENet network to reduce the computational overhead of CNN and to achieve the recognition and classification of different malware at the output layer. The examples under the public dataset containing 8 kinds of malware show that the proposed method is better than the traditional algorithmic model, and can accurately and efficiently achieve malware detection with strong generalization ability.},

With increasing industrialization and urbanization pollution levels are increasing. Relying on age old long calculative methods for water quality prediction is simply wastage of our resources. Nowadays collected data is also a resource. If we use Machine Learning models, dependency on manual calculation and identification of degraded parameter can pave way to enhancement.

  title={Machine Learning Framework for Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease Stages Using Optimized Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={78057-78072},
  abstract={Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that requires accurate diagnosis and staging for effective clinical management. Conventional CKD diagnosis relies on estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function derived from serum biomarkers such as serum creatinine (SCr) and cystatin C (SCysC). However, eGFR calculations may be inaccurate when applied to diverse patient populations. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) system that integrates regression-based eGFR estimation, metaheuristic optimization using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and multi-class classification with various ML models to enhance CKD staging and classification. The model estimates eGFR using three established CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations incorporating SCr, SCysC, and their combined values. Regression models assess predictive performance, specifically Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR demonstrates superior performance compared to LR for  $\text {CKD-EPI}_{\text {SCr-SCysC}}$  achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.03, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.97%, and a coefficient of determination ( $\text {R}^{2}$ ) score of 0.97. The application of GWO for hyperparameter tuning has resulted in a 37.3% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE), a 37.4% drop in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and a 2.06% improvement in  $\text {R}^{2}$  to improve the precision of prediction. Once the model fine-tunes the eGFR estimations, it feeds them into various algorithms for CKD stage classification, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Among these, XGBoost achieves the highest classification accuracy of 97.76%, along with an F1-score of 97.45%, demonstrating its effectiveness in CKD staging. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide global and local feature importance insights, enhancing clinical decision-making and model transparency. Future research will validate the model using more extensive and more diverse datasets. Additionally, it will incorporate extra clinical parameters, including biomarkers and genetic data, to enhance the precision of CKD risk prediction. This research enhances AI-driven nephrology by providing a scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate solution for diagnosing and managing CKD.},

  abstract={Early breast cancer diagnosis is crucial for improving treatment outcomes for women. Addressing class imbalance in breast cancer data is essential for enhancing detection accuracy, yet traditional machine learning methods often overlook this imbalance, limiting their classification performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a robust enhanced ensemble learning method (REEL). Specifically, a double-level over-sampling technology is developed to increase the diversity of synthesized minority breast cancer samples before model training, and an improved Random Forest is proposed to reconcile the bias and variance. In addition, a data-driven based particle swarm optimization algorithm automatically is used to select the value of parameters for base classifiers. Experimental results on breast cancer datasets and 19 other imbalanced datasets validate that our method outperforms other algorithms in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and AUC.These findings confirm that our method can further improve classification accuracy and has significant application value in the diagnosis of breast cancer.},

Encouraged by the successful application on discovering convolutional and recurrent neural networks, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is extended to alleviate the complexity of designing appropriate task-specific GNNs. Unfortunately, existing graph NAS methods are usually susceptible to unscalable depth, redundant computation, constrained search space and some other limitations. In this paper, we present an evolutionary graph neural network architecture search strategy, involving inheritance, crossover and mutation operators based on fine-grained atomic operations. Specifically, we design two novel crossover operators at different granularity levels, GNNCross and LayerCross. Experiments on three different graph learning tasks indicate that the neural architectures generated by our method exhibit comparable performance to the handcrafted and automated baseline GNN models.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of heavy-haul railway technology, the demand for the faster transmission and higher bandwidth capacity of wireless communication network is also increasing. Therefore, Long Term Evolution for Railway (LTE-R) begin to replace Global System for Mobile Communications for Railway (GSM-R) to burden the core wireless communication services. In order to improve the operation and maintenance efficiency of LTE-R network, this paper proposes a multi-step LTE-R communication quality prediction method based on Differential Evolution algorithm and Temporal Convolutional Network with Coordinate Attention (TCNCA). Firstly, this method uses differential evolution and permutation importance index to filter the features of multivariate LTE-R communication quality data. Then, the coordinate attention mechanism and TCN network were fused to build the prediction model. Finally, this method still used Differential Evolution to adjust the model parameters based on Mann—Kendall test, so that the model could take into account the prediction accuracy and the trend of data change, thus realize the multi-step prediction for LTE-R communication quality. Experimental results on real data set show that the proposed method can provide decision support for the active maintenance of LTE-R network, and has high application value.},

  abstract={When we manually design an evolutionary optimization algorithm, we implicitly or explicitly assume a set of target optimization problems. In the case of automated algorithm design, target optimization problems are usually explicitly shown. Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) for the design of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been examined in some studies. In those studies, target multi-objective problems are not always explicitly shown. It is well known in the EMO community that the performance evaluation results of EMO algorithms depend on not only test problems but also many other factors such as performance indicators, reference point, termination condition, and population size. Thus, it is likely that the designed EMO algorithms by LLMs depends on those factors. In this paper, we try to examine the implicit assumption (i.e., implicit knowledge) about the performance comparison of EMO algorithms in LLMs. For this purpose, we ask LLMs to design a benchmarking experiment of EMO algorithms. Our experiments show that LLMs often suggest classical benchmark settings: Performance examination of NSGA-II, MOEA/D and NSGA-III on ZDT, DTLZ and WFG by HV and IGD under the standard parameter specifications.},

  abstract={A multi-objective derived Adaptive TransDeepLabv3 (ATransDeeplabv3) with a meta-heuristic approach Electric Fish optimization (EFO) Algorithm is proposed in this paper. The Deeplabv3 network’s segmentation results are unsatisfactory when it comes to unequal sample categories and a shortage of data, but having higher segmentation accuracy for species with adequate instances. To address the issue of uneven sample categories, designed a Deeplabv3 network model that adds a Transformer encoder based on a multihead self-attention mechanism and EFO Algorithm. An Electric Fish Optimization algorithm is utilized in order to improve the effectiveness of the proposed model, and it is primarily used to maximize the accuracy and dice coefficient of the ATransDeeplabv3 by tuning the hyper parameters like number of epochs, number of steps per epoch and hidden neuron count. The suggested Adaptive TransDeepLabv3 is tested using the public domain dataset named Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Imagery and obtained an improved accuracy, dice-coefficient, Jaccard Index and F1-Score values of 97.82%, 97.95%, 98.24% and 97.95% respectively with a computational time of 119.2891 seconds.

  title={Research on the Optimization of Sample Point Placement for Ground Substrate Survey based on Interpretable Machine Learning}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={To obtain comprehensive and accurate data, it is necessary to conduct field surveys of ground substrate, arable land, soil quality, and other natural resource classes. This is in difficult and key areas. Manual sweeping can improve survey accuracy, but the investment in human and material resources, and the long survey cycle can complicate taking into account the impact of geological, hydrological, soil, and other factors on the deployment of sample points. In addition, technical experts can be relied on for expertise, professionalism, and a scientific approach. However, generalizability is weak due to its subjective nature. Machine learning can form an efficient and scientific scheme to deploy sample points. A large amount of data, such as soil, geology, and meteorology, can be simulated using machine learning models to generate effective multidimensional data features for engineering, identify potential patterns, and optimize sample point locations and quantities based on nonlinear and higher-order interactions. In contrast to traditional black box models that use prediction accuracy as a single metric, interpretable machine learning (IML) provides insight into how the model learns and makes predictions. As a result, we will be able to identify potential biases and errors more easily and build more reliable sample point placement models. In this study, we proposed the RF-GA algorithm, which integrates environmental factor data often relied on by experts’ judgments, such as topography, soil type, elevation, slope, surface cover, and historical soil texture. By using genetic algorithms to filter variables, the feature space can be optimized. A plan is developed for surface matrix survey points in northeast Tieling using intermediate scale factor modeling. There are a variety of ecosystems and topography types in the Tieling area, which lies between the Liaohe Plain and Liaodong mountainous hilly area. An optimized plan for regional ground substrate survey point placement was finally determined after nearly 110,000 calculations. The optimized scheme generated by the RF-GA algorithm and the expert manual scheme (1:250,00 survey accuracy) are similar by 87%, and the RF-GA rule adopts an iterative progression of prime points of a certain surface cover, and the point placement scheme reflects improved refinement and sampling point representativeness. As part of the exploration of similar environment judgments, the scheme optimized 785 points (swept survey) to 136, utilizing zonal classification and hierarchical sample point deployment. The RF-GA algorithm found that the main factors affecting point deployment are topography, historical soil texture, and slope. As both plain and hilly terrain are considered in the study area, RF-GA has high generalizability and can be applied to plains, hills, and transition zones between them. We have demonstrated the feasibility of RF-GA sample point placement based on interpretable machine learning, which is valuable for ground substrate surveys and point optimization research.},

  abstract={Time-series data such as fMRI and MEG carry a wealth of inherent spatio-temporal coupling relationship, and their modeling via deep learning is essential for uncovering biological mechanisms. However, current machine learning models for mining spatio-temporal information usually overlook this intrinsic coupling association, in addition to poor explainability. In this paper, we present an explainable learning framework for spatio-temporal coupling. Specifically, this framework constructs a deep learning network based on spatio-temporal correlation, which can well integrate the time-varying coupled relationships between node representation and inter-node connectivity. Furthermore, it explores spatio-temporal evolution at each time step, providing a better explainability of the analysis results. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to brain dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that it can effectively capture the variations in dFC during brain development and the evolution of spatio-temporal information at the resting state. Two distinct developmental functional connectivity (FC) patterns are identified. Specifically, the connectivity among regions related to emotional regulation decreases, while the connectivity associated with cognitive activities increases. In addition, children and young adults display notable cyclic fluctuations in resting-state brain dFC.},

Subsequently, during the spacecraft transfer process, it considers using continuous-thrust transfer, utilizing Pontryagin’s minimum principle to transform the fuel-optimal continuous-thrust transfer problem into a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP), then rapidly generating a continuous-thrust dataset to train a surrogate model for evaluating continuous-thrust cost. Furthermore, PN-attention is proposed, which is derived from a pointer network (PN) model that incorporates attention computation, aimed at learning the sequence planning of ADR problems. In the validation and discussion section, PN-attention’s performance in solving ADR problems is compared with various heuristic algorithms, verifying its effectiveness, optimality, generalizability, and solution speed.},

It takes time to sift through large amounts of content, especially when manually creating accurate summaries of big publications. Automating the summarization process is crucial to increase the effectiveness of machine learning models.

The T5, GPT2 and BART pre-trained transformer models for abstractive news summarization will be compared in this study. For our investigation, we have used the CNN/Dailymail dataset, which includes summaries created by humans for assessing and contrasting the summaries produced by various models.

  pages={156-162},
  abstract={The determination of criteria weights is known to be a challenging and complex issue, particularly for the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems involved in the assessment of Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS). Traditionally, assessment methodologies for CPPS have often leveraged a Multi-Index Assessment Framework (MIAF) approach, whose involved MCDM problems have various competing objectives and/or attributes that need to be optimized concurrently; yet, the utilized Adaptive Weighting Methodologies (AWM) have often been beset with selection bias (e.g., particular indices utilized, heuristics formulated, parameters selected, etc). The selection bias issue has been compounded even further when the utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision-support mechanisms also have inherent selection bias; this phenomenon has contributed to the Explainable AI (XAI) movement. This paper’s mitigation approach is two-pronged. First, a mitigation approach to the AWM selection bias centers upon the use of an AWM that considers/hybridizes various subjective and objective approaches. For example, a bespoke Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-CRiteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) et al. hybridized construct (C#1) conjoined with a bespoke R-Fuzzy Set (RFS), Adaptation of the Grey Relational Analysis (AGRA), and New Normalized Projection Entropy Weighting Model (NNP-EWM) et al. construct (C#2) can reduce the AWM selection bias. Along with AGRA, C#2 can leverage Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (T2FS) and Spherical Fuzzy Set (SFS) AWM-derived entropy weights to support C#1. This paper further facilitates the C#1 and C#2 constructs with an Extended Matrix Shanks Transformation Accelerant (EMSTA). Second, a mitigation approach to the involved AI selection bias is to leverage a bespoke AWM Support Layer (ASL) in the form of a Particle Swarm Optimization-based Robust Convex Relaxation (PSO-RCR) pseudo-white-box construct, which operationalizes the tightest possible relaxation for the involved successive neural network convolutional layers (which contain the cascading of ever-smaller Continuous Wavelet Transform-like convolutional filters). Hence, both the AWM and AI selection bias are reduced, and a principal contribution of this paper is the enhanced efficacy of the MIAF for use with CPPS, particularly those which are potentially vulnerable to a Sequential Topology Attack (STA) effectuated by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Insider Threat Paradigm (ITP). Preliminary results indicate that the C#1 and C#2 amalgam has high efficacy, and the performance, numerical stability, and consistency of the results — when leveraging EMSTA — is promising.},

  abstract={The object recognition is an essential field in computer vision which comprises locating and recognizing objects within a given input image. The basic principle of these techniques is utilized to recognize certain object and detect their location through generating a list of squares to surround the object. This paper proposed a You Only Look Once Version3 (YOLOV3)-MobileNet for recognizing the object. The Caltech101 dataset is utilized in this research and preprocessed through min-max normalization and contrast enhancement techniques.

  abstract={This work is part of the ‘Predicting Neurological Recovery from Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023’ to investigate the predictive potential of bipolar electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings towards efficient prediction of poor neurological outcomes. A retrospective design using a hybrid deep learning approach is utilized to optimize an objective function aiming for high specificity, i.e., true positive rate (TPR) with reduced false positives (<0.05). A multichannel EEG array of 18 bipolar channel pairs from a randomly selected 5-minute segment in an hour is kept. In order to determine the outcome prediction, a combination of a feature encoder with 1-D convolutional layers, learnable position encoding, a context network with attention mechanisms, and finally, a regressor and classifier blocks are used. The feature encoder extricates local temporal and spatial features, while the following position encoding and attention mechanisms attempt to capture global temporal dependencies. Results: The proposed framework by our team, OUS_IVS, when validated on the challenge hidden test data, exhibited an unofficial score (not ranked) of 0.416 at 72 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation.

  abstract={For rolling bearing fault diagnosis., extracting the features which can represent current signal is vital. However.,its large reconstruction error and complex signal sources bring challenges to fault diagnosis. Therefore., a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) optimized by Subtraction-Average-Based Optimizer (SABO) and enhanced Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly., VMD is used to decompose the bearing signal into different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)., and then SABO is used to find the best IMF to represent the bearing signal. Then., BiLSTM is used to extract the timing features., and make the final decision. Finally., the feasibility of the proposed method is verified on the dataset of Western Reserve University. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively classify the bearing signal. Compared with several methods., the performance of this proposed method is better than those of other methods.},

  abstract={A significant part of the information available on the internet is fake news which is generated to influence the decision of individuals politically and socially. Detecting fake news from social media has become a very important problem. It can be done either manually or by using Deep Learning. In this work, we focus on detecting fake news with Transformer models of Deep Learning. We analyze the performance of Transformer models like BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and Longformer. We also propose two novel approaches by combining Information Gain and Genetic Algorithm with all these models for further improving their results. The models based on our proposed approaches show better results than the previous models. Among all the models, Longformer and RoBERTa using Genetic Algorithm give the best result when 80% unique keywords are used. The micro average F1-score of both methods is 0.62. Our proposed approaches also reduce the training text dimension due to which computing time for training the models reduce too.},

  abstract={One of the most promising application areas of Internet of Things' (IoT) is healthcare. Humans experience stress, a delicate psycho-physiological state, in reaction to important things or occasions. Environmental influences are known as stress variables. The emotional state of a person health may be significantly influenced by prolonged explanation to multiple upsetting experiences at once, which may lead to unsolved health issues. Early detection of strain issues is crucial for prevention, and this can only be done by regular stress monitoring. Continuous and real-time data collection is made possible by wearable devices, which contributes to an increase. This work uses deep learning-based techniques and detecting devices to implement an analysis of stress discovery. The proposed study aims to explore stress detection methods in various contexts, including travel and education, and in conjunction with hardware such as heart rate variability (HRV), electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Genetic algorithm is applied to separate the features, and the Stress Monitoring Algorithm - Long Short Term Memory (SMA-LSTM) is used to arrange the given data using dataset values. Pre-processing methods is used for eliminating signal artifacts are given beforehand. A report is sent to the patient or doctor by an expert who predicts mental stress via the Internet when the stress level exceeds the threshold value, labelling it as emergency or alert. Lastly, the accuracy, f1score, and precision are analyzed and compared, and recall outcomes to latest technique.},

  abstract={Explainability in Artificial Intelligence is gaining increasing importance, especially in critical fields. In biomedical applications, attribution maps are particularly relevant for their inherent spatial localization property. Features that are relevant for a given task (e.g., classification of cases versus controls) can then be associated to specific regions, revealing disease-specific modulations and enabling ad-hoc post-hoc validation. Among these, baseline-dependent methods require a neutral image (called baseline) for computing the feature importance. The choice of the baseline is critical in that it determines the relevance map. In this work, we focused on a classification task, that is, subject stratification based on the amyloid-β and τ status in controls and patients in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, and employed Integrated Gradients to extract the attribution maps. This allowed identifying relevant brain regions driving the classification. Aware of the dependence of the outcomes from the chosen baseline, post-hoc statistical analysis was performed for validating the results confirming their plausibility. This puts forth the need to systematically assess the impact of the baseline for the correct interpretation of the corresponding outcomes.},

  abstract={Fine-grained image classification (FGIC) is an important computer vision task with many real-world applications. However, FGIC is challenging due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities, especially when there is limited training data. To address these challenges, a new genetic programming approach with flexible region detection, GP-RD, is proposed for different FGIC tasks, i.e., flower and fish classification tasks. The proposed GP-RD approach can automatically highlight the object, detect regions of interest, extract effective features, and combine global, local, and/or color features for classification. The performance of GP-RD is evaluated on flower and fish classification tasks within the FGIC domain, utilizing datasets with varying classes. In comparison with seven benchmark methods, GP-RD achieves significantly better performance in most comparisons. Further analysis demonstrates the interpretability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Microwave antenna design optimization has always been a challenge due to the intricate relationships between design parameters and signal strength. Traditional models often fail to capture the nuanced interactions between these parameters. Drawing inspiration from the dynamics of a forest ecosystem, we introduce the Forest Resonance Model (FRM) to estimate signal strength based on antenna design parameters. The primary goal of this research is to develop and validate a novel forest-inspired model that can accurately predict the signal strength of microwave antennas based on design parameters. The FRM offers a fresh perspective on microwave antenna design optimization by bridging the gap between nature-inspired concepts and machine learning and highlights the potential of drawing inspiration from natural systems for complex engineering challenges. The FRM conceptualizes each antenna design as a tree, with its attributes such as TestFreq, PatchLength, PatchWidth, SlotLength, and SlotWidth determining its height, base width, and health. The interactions between these “trees” (antenna designs) mimic the feature space interactions in machine learning. We implemented this concept using a modified Random Forest algorithm, incorporating feature engineering techniques to capture combined effects of design parameters. The dataset, comprising different antenna designs and their corresponding signal strengths, was used to train and validate the model. Preliminary results indicate that the our enhanced FRM model provides superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional models. The feature importance scores derived from the model shed light on the most influential design parameters, offering insights into optimal antenna design. The manufactured optimized antenna design was confirmed through a series of signal strength measurements in lab environment.},

  abstract={Consumer segmentation is a very effective methodology that could enable organizations to gain a deeper comprehension of their consumer base and customize their tactics accordingly in order to cater to their unique requirements. Through the process of categorizing clients according to common attributes, organizations can acquire valuable knowledge regarding their requirements, inclinations, and purchasing behaviors. This comprehension empowers firms to develop focused marketing strategies and provide customized experiences that foster customer loyalty and enhance revenue generation. The prevalent categories of criteria in consumer segmentation encompass demographic, psychographic, geographic, and behavioral factors, whilst the prevailing methodologies for constructing customer segments involve rule-based and cluster-based techniques. Rule-based segmentation involves the utilization of pre-established rules to allocate clients into distinct segments. Conversely, cluster-based segmentation employs statistical techniques to identify inherent clusters or groups within the customer population. This research investigates the application of the K-Means clustering technique for the purpose of segmenting customer behavioral data into several categories, namely Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, or Bad. The clustering approach employed demonstrated a notable degree of accuracy and precision. Through the implementation of an appropriate strategy for customer segmentation, organizations have the potential to strengthen their product offers, concentrate their marketing communications, and augment client loyalty.},

Firstly, the vibration signal is preprocessed, and the importance of each feature is calculated by using the Gini coefficient in the random forest to select the time domain features and frequency domain features with high weight. Then the health status is divided by hierarchical clustering. Finally, the health status of bearing is evaluated by DE-ELM. DE-ELM not only has simple structure and fast convergence speed, but also can make up for the decline of classification accuracy of extreme learning machine, caused by the random generation of parameters. From experimental results, comparing with the traditional ELM model, the optimized model has higher classification accuracy and better health state recognition effect.},

  year={2024},
  volume={24},

  pages={28941-28951},
  abstract={Video game development heavily relies on gaming emotions of players. Video games can trigger emotions that lead to hatred, aggressiveness, sadness, addiction, suicidal thoughts, etc. The effect of emotions can be reduced by studying the player’s emotional state. The emotional state influences the psychological state. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generated due to neurological changes in the brain give accurate information about psychological states. This work introduces the adaptive flexible analytic wavelet transform (AFAWT) for detecting emotions using EEG signals. In AFAWT, parametric optimization finds the best basis function for representing EEG signals. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve an inequality constraint problem, enabling the selection of appropriate AFAWT parameters. The AFAWT decomposes the EEG signal into subbands (SBs). The SBs’ time-domain measures serve as features for classifying emotions in EEG signals. A post hoc multiple comparison analysis using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test ensures the significance of the extracted features. Different classification algorithms test the obtained features for each SB. The hyperparameters of the classifiers neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble (EN), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) are optimized using ten-fold cross-validation and Bayesian optimization. Among the optimized classifiers, optimizable k-NN shows the best classification accuracy of 90.3% for four classes of emotions. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method performs better on the same dataset.},

  abstract={MRI imaging plays a vital role in the initial tumor screening process and also aids in constructing a high-dimensional feature space for survival prediction tasks through the combination of sequences and tumor subregions. Traditional GP methods applied to feature construction treat features as part of the terminal set, which limits their search capabilities. Combining feature learning with GP allows for the direct use of image data, albeit dependent on predefined extraction functions. Our goal is to design a FLFC method that integrates feature learning and construction to automatically locate ROIs, extract features, construct new features, and match classifiers in 3D MRI images. To this end, we have introduced a new GP structure with an interpretable function set. To verify the algorithm, experiments were performed using the publicly available BraTS 2020 dataset. Ours achieved an average accuracy of 94.14% in the binary classification task (differentiating between HGG and LGG) and 72.49% in the four-class task (within HGG subtypes). These results underscore the efficacy of the FLFC method in harnessing the complexity of MRI data for meaningful survival prediction, illustrating its potential as a robust tool in medical imaging analysis and cancer prognosis.},
