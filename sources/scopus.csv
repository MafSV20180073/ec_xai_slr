This paper aims to take on the stance detection task by placing the emphasis not so much on the text itself but on the interaction data available on social networks. More specifically, we propose a new method to leverage social information such as friends and retweets by generating Relational Embeddings, namely, dense vector representations of interaction pairs. Our experiments on seven publicly available datasets and four different languages (Basque, Catalan, Italian, and Spanish) show that combining our relational embeddings with discriminative textual methods helps to substantially improve performance, obtaining state-of-the-art results for six out of seven evaluation settings, outperforming strong baselines based on Large Language Models, or other popular interaction-based approaches such as DeepWalk or node2vec. ©2025 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.","Interactions; Large Language Models; Multilinguality; Natural Language Processing; Social Networks; Stance Detection","","","Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001988788"

A critical factor affecting the effectiveness of this strengthening method is the bond behavior between Fe-SMA and parent structures. However, due to the multitude of influencing factors, especially the effect of long-term hygrothermal environments, predicting bond strength is complex and time-consuming. In light of these challenges, machine learning (ML) offers an efficient scheme for predicting bond strength. This study uses explainable ML models to predict the bond strength of Fe-SMA/steel single joints (SJs). The performance of Spearman-based, importance-based, and norm-based feature selection methods is investigated to identify the most representative feature combinations. Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO), and African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) are employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of random forest (RF) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). Additionally, the best-performing model is interpreted utilizing Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP). The results demonstrate that GTO and SSA enhance the performance of RF and BPNN to the greatest extent, respectively. Compared to unoptimized algorithms, the prediction accuracy of GTO-RF and SSA-BPNN gets improved by 29.98 % and 44.15 %, respectively. Guaranteeing the quality of adhesives is essential for the mechanical performance of Fe-SMA-bonded strengthening structures, given the strong correlation between adhesive property and bond strength. Feature dependence analysis identifies that the effective length of SJs approaches 125 mm. This study offers valuable and innovative solutions for improving the quality and efficiency of Fe-SMA-bonded strengthening design for building maintenance. Its primary advantage lies in the integration of multiple optimization algorithms and explainable ML techniques. These approaches not only improve prediction accuracy but also enhance model interpretability, providing more reliable guidance for practical engineering applications. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","Back-propagation neural network; Bond strength; Fe-SMA/steel single joint; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Random forest; Shapley additive explanation","Model structures; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring; Back-propagation neural networks; Bond strength; Fe-SMA/steel single joint; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Machine learning models; Optimizers; Random forests; Search Algorithms; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Bond strength (materials)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007599089"

However, solving the Vehicle and Multi-Drone Cooperative Delivery Problem with Delivery Restrictions is challenging due to complex constraints, including limited payloads, short endurance, regional restrictions, and multi-objective optimization. Traditional optimization methods, particularly genetic algorithms, struggle to address these complexities, often relying on static rules or single-objective optimization that fails to balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in local optima and slow convergence. The concept of symmetry plays a crucial role in optimizing the scheduling process, as many logistics problems inherently possess symmetrical properties. By exploiting these symmetries, we can reduce the problem’s complexity and improve solution efficiency. This study proposes a novel and scalable scheduling approach to address the Vehicle and Multi-Drone Cooperative Delivery Problem with Delivery Restrictions, tackling its high complexity, constraint handling, and real-world applicability. Specifically, we propose a logistics scheduling method called Loegised, which integrates large language models with genetic algorithms while incorporating symmetry principles to enhance the optimization process. Loegised includes three innovative modules: a cognitive initialization module to accelerate convergence by generating high-quality initial solutions, a dynamic operator parameter adjustment module to optimize crossover and mutation rates in real-time for better global search, and a local optimum escape mechanism to prevent stagnation and improve solution diversity. The experimental results on benchmark datasets show that Loegised achieves an average delivery time of 14.80, significantly outperforming six state-of-the-art baseline methods, with improvements confirmed by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests ((Formula presented.)). In large-scale scenarios, Loegised reduces delivery time by over 20% compared to conventional methods, demonstrating strong scalability and practical applicability. These findings validate the effectiveness and real-world potential of symmetry-enhanced, language model-guided optimization for advanced logistics scheduling. © 2025 by the authors.","dynamic constraints; genetic algorithm; large language models; logistics scheduling; multi-drone cooperative delivery; optimization algorithm","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009141413"

However, optimization processes must treat various systems theory concepts, such as stability and controllability, differently, as swarm optimization relies on preserving diversity rather than reaching uniform agent behavior. This work addresses this duality of perspective and proposes State-Space Particle Swarm Optimization (SS-PSO) using the feedback concept in control systems theory. By exploiting the hidden analogy between these two paradigms, we introduce the concept of controllability for optimization purposes through state-space representation. Extending controllability to particle swarm optimization (PSO) highlights the ability to span the search space, emphasizing the significance of particles' movement rather than their loss of diversity. Furthermore, adaptive exploration (AE) using an iterative bisection algorithm is proposed for the PSO parameters that leverages this controllability measure and its minimum singular value to facilitate explainable swarm behaviors and escape local minima. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that SS-PSO is only uncontrollable when the cognitive factor is zero, implying less exploration. Finally, AE enhances exploration by increasing the controllability matrix's minimum singular value. This result underscores the profound connection between the controllability matrix and exploration, a critical insight that significantly enhances our understanding of swarm optimization. AE-based State-Space-PSO (AESS-PSO) shows improved exploration and performance over PSO in 86 SOP and CEC benchmarks, particularly for smaller populations. © 2025","Adaptive exploration; Controllability; Particle swarm optimization; State feedback control; Theoretical framework","Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive control systems; Benchmarking; Feedback control; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); State feedback; Swarm intelligence; System theory; Adaptive explorations; Minimum singular value; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; State feedback control; State-space; Swarm behavior; Swarm optimization; Theoretical framework; Controllability","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219118414"

Causal reasoning, particularly at Pearl’s interventional and counterfactual levels, is critical for achieving true general intelligence. In this study, we propose a causal reasoning framework that includes a three-axis taxonomy for causality, designed to capture the intent, action requirements, and the three rungs of causality as defined by Pearl: associational, interventional, and counterfactual; and a human-in-the-loop approach to generate golden collections of natural causal questions, annotated according to the proposal taxonomy. We evaluated the seed questions of a golden collection in Portuguese using the LLM GPT-4o and Llama3.1 with two prompt strategies.

Prediction of gas holdup assumes importance in the design of airlift contactor. The key challenge in prediction of gas holdup is due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable phenomenological models. The improved prediction accuracies can provide better contactor design and equipment performance. The current work focuses on the use of data driven models for prediction of gas holdup, as the existing empirical correlations were found to be inadequate. In this work, 324 data points from the reported works on internal draft airlift contactor are consolidated. The input part of the examples in the data set consists of ten features which are related to geometry, fluid properties and operating conditions. This study improves the predictive accuracy of gas holdup, the output variable, in ILACs using a Random Forest (RF) model optimized via Genetic Algorithms (GA).

Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, our approach integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM’s quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate our approach in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.

Not only can software defects lead to system failure, but they can also have serious economic and social consequences. Most of the current methods rely on a single type of feature and fail to explore the multiple information in the code fully. Meanwhile, manually tuning hyperparameters is both time-consuming and difficult to achieve optimal results. Based on the encoder architecture, this research proposes an enhanced software defect prediction model, which combines the self-attention mechanism and particle swarm optimization (PSO-BiEncoders-SelfAttn). This model achieves efficient feature extraction, dynamic adjustment of feature fusion weights, and automated optimization of hyperparameters. This study trained and tested the model on five different publicly available datasets and evaluated it using metrics including precision, recall, and F-measure.

However, traditional clustering methods only provide a set of results without any explanations. While numerous methods in the literature attempt to explain clustering results, the explanation rules provided by these models are fixed and sacrificing clustering quality for the sake of making the rules easier to understand. To address this, this paper proposes a feature selection model to balance the interpretability and clustering quality. The model consists of two stages. In the first stage, the concept of explanatory radius is defined, and the explanatory radius of each cluster in the initial clustering results is calculated. In the second stage, a feature subspace is selected, and the dataset is re-clustered in this subspace using a proposed formula to obtain a new clustering result. Three objective functions are designed to evaluate the performance of the new clustering results in terms of cluster quality and interpretability. Subsequently, the model utilizes a multi-objective optimization framework to optimize the three objective functions in the solution space formed by different feature subspaces, resulting in a set of Pareto solutions. Each solution in the Pareto set represents a trade-off between clustering quality and interpretability. Finally, the contribution of features during the generation process of each cluster is used to represent the interpretability of each cluster’s result. The proposed method is validated on both artificial datasets and real-world datasets, and comparative analyses are conducted with the latest explainable clustering algorithms in the literature. The analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","Feature selection; interpretability; K-means clustering","Adversarial machine learning; Feature Selection; K-means clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Unsupervised learning; Clustering quality; Clustering results; Clusterings; Feature subspace; Features selection; Interpretability; K-means; K-means++ clustering; Objective functions; Optimization framework; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003652756"

IIoT networks, while enhancing service quality, are particularly susceptible to security risks because of their intrinsic interconnectedness and the use of low-power devices. The data produced by millions of sensors in the IIoT is highly dynamic, diverse, and of massive magnitude. The risk of dangers to IoT gadgets in a nuclear plant or a petroleum refinery is significantly greater when compared to that of home appliances. Often connected to the internet, IIoT devices and systems lack robust security measures, rendering them susceptible to cyberattacks. A breach in IIoT security could result in data theft, equipment damage, or even physical harm. To mitigate these risks, IIoT systems require secure authentication and encryption protocols, regular software updates, and proactive monitoring and response capabilities. These methods' primary disadvantages are their difficulty in implementation and inability to ensure effective security. Hence, a second line of protection, such as intrusion threat detection in IIoT, is required. In this research, we propose a new threat intrusion detection model in the IIoT through a genetic algorithm with attention mechanism and modified Adam optimized LSTM (GA-mADAM-IIoT). The GA-mADAM-IIoT consists of six modules: the activity receiver, communication module (CM), attention module (AM), intrusion detection module, mitigation module, and alert module. The GA was designed for feature dimensionality and selection trained on network flow data via a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was modified in order to optimize the LSTM (mADAM-LSTM) networks. To enhance the performance of our model, the categorical cross-entropy (CCE) cost function was used to calculate the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Additionally, the CCE cost function optimized the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values in terms of probability distributions. The Modified Adam (mADAM) optimization algorithm updates the weights and biases of the LSTM to minimize the cost function. Due to the limited availability of real-world datasets containing accurately labelled anomalies, particularly for industrial facilities and manufacturing facilities, we have utilized two sensor datasets derived from physical test-bed systems for water treatment: Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and Water Distribution (WADI). In these datasets, operators have simulated attack scenarios that occur in real-world water treatment plants and have recorded these instances as the ground truth anomalies. A regularization parameter was added to the cost function to prevent LSTM from overfitting. In order to improve the model's performance, the AM integrates a succinct yet effective attention mechanism that enhances significant information in the output of the CM. This reduces the burden on GA-mADAM-IIoT to detect threat patterns at the IDS module. The experimental findings showed that the threat detection GA-mADAM-IIoT via GA feature dimensionality and modified Adam LSTM outperforms the ablation studies. Furthermore, we improve the suggested transparency of threat detection by integrating the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) technique from Explainable AI. This enhances the trustworthiness and comprehensibility of the threat detection process. The proposed model was also compared with the state-of-the-art models, and our results showed outstanding accuracy of 99.98 %, AUC of 100 %, recall of 99.98 %, precision of 99.98 %, F1 of 99.98 %, and MCC of 99.66 % on SWaT data.

In order to effectively predict warpage, traditional methods use a large amount of data to perform statistical analysis. However, in the actual field, obtaining detailed parameter data for each process requires a lot of time and manpower, which makes statistical method impractical. In other words, achieving accurate warpage prediction with limited data is crucial. Therefore, this research proposes an artificial neural network model with genetic algorithms to enhance warpage prediction. The proposed algorithm uses genetic algorithms to achieve optimize the hyperparameter of artificial neural network (ANN), which is called Genetic Algorithm Optimized Artificial Neural Network (GA-NN), the algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed and performance of the ANN. The data set was generated by the finite element method from the semiconductor packaging product feature data. Compared with other algorithms, the product data simulated by the proposed method can maintain numerical stability and achieve rapid convergence. In the proposed ANN, an interpretable AI algorithm - SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is also used to further analyze various input parameters and quantify the operation results of the machine learning model. The empirical result shows that the prediction has an error of only 3 % on Molding Functional Chip Ball Grid Array (MFCBGA) package products. Compared with traditional algorithms and other machine learning methods, the proposed algorithm performs faster and with higher prediction accuracy, while providing product feature influence and visualizes the direct relationship between product specifications and warpage. To sum up, this research achieves effective package warpage prediction, while further explains the relationship between warpage generation in the AI model, input data and prediction targets to customers. Finally, the product design cycle can be reduced and the product quality can be improved simultaneously. © 2025 IEEE.","Explainable; FEM simulation; machine learning; MFCBGA; SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)","Additives; Chip scale packages; Finite element method; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Integrated circuits; Intelligent control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Packaging; Product design; Specifications; Statistical methods; Timing circuits; Ball-grid arrays; Explainable; FEM simulations; Functionals; Machine-learning; Molding functional chip ball grid array; Neural-networks; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Warpages; Learning systems","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Electronics Packaging Society (EPS)","75th IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference, ECTC 2025","27 May 2025 through 30 May 2025","Dallas","210005","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010604052"

Although, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is utilized as a standard measurement to assess psoriasis severity in clinical trials, it has many draw-backs such as (1) patient burden for in-person clinic visits for assessment of psoriasis, (2) time required for investigator scoring and (3) variability of inter-and intra-rater scoring. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel and inter-pretable deep learning architecture called PSO-Net, which maps digital images from different anatomical regions to derive attention-based scores. Regional scores are further combined to estimate an absolute PASI score. Moreover, we devise a novel regression activation map for interpretability through ranking attention scores. Using this approach, we achieved inter-class correlation scores of 82.2% [95% CI: 77- 87%] and 87.8% [95% CI: 84-91%] with two different clinician raters, respectively. © 2025 IEEE.","Attention; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; PASI; Psoriasis","Area index; Assessment system; Attention; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Neural-networks; Psoriasi; Psoriasi area and severity index; Severity index; Skin conditions; Convolutional neural networks","","IEEE Computer Society","et al.; Houston Methodist; IEEE Signal Processing Society; United Imaging; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Verasonics","22nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, ISBI 2025","14 April 2025 through 17 April 2025","Houston","208856","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005824989"

However, creating such questions manually is challenging and time-consuming, especially for specialized fields. In this paper, we explore how generative large language models (LLMs) can be exploited to generate MCQs from instructional texts that serve as tests for vocational qualification assessment. We focus on two topics—basic first aid and production scheduling in companies—for which we created two datasets of parallel course texts in Spanish and Basque. The manual evaluation reveals that both the open-source Llama3 instructed models (8B and 70B) and the proprietary GPT-4o can generate MCQs of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting for Spanish. No significant differences were observed in performance based on model size or licensing type, with performance rates of 91%, 84%, and 80% for GPT-4o, Llama3-70B, and Llama3-8B, respectively. However, the results for Basque show a marked decline, with performance dropping to 70% for GPT-4o and 59% for Llama3-70B, and a notably low 27% for Llama3-8B.

However, traditional predictive maintenance methods often face challenges in adapting to diverse industrial environments and ensuring the transparency and fairness of their predictions. This paper presents a novel predictive maintenance framework that integrates deep learning and optimization techniques while addressing key ethical considerations, such as transparency, fairness, and explainability, in artificial intelligence driven decision-making. The framework employs an Autoencoder for feature reduction, a Convolutional Neural Network for pattern recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory network for temporal analysis. To enhance transparency, the decision-making process of the framework is made interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand and trust the model’s predictions. Additionally, Particle Swarm Optimization is used to refine hyperparameters for optimal performance and mitigate potential biases in the model. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets from different industrial scenarios, with performance validated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time metrics. The results demonstrate an impressive accuracy of up to 99.92% and 99.45% across different datasets, highlighting the framework’s effectiveness in enhancing predictive maintenance strategies. Furthermore, the model’s explainability ensures that the decisions can be audited for fairness and accountability, aligning with ethical standards for critical systems. By addressing transparency and reducing potential biases, this framework contributes to the responsible and trustworthy deployment of artificial intelligence in industrial environments, particularly in safety-critical applications. The results underscore its potential for wide application across various industrial contexts, enhancing both performance and ethical decision-making.

Recently, large language models have been suggested as potential tools for various applications in health care. OBJECTIVE: Assess suggested management recommendations provided by a generative artificial intelligence chatbot with those of a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team to evaluate applicability in clinical settings. DESIGN: Comparative pilot study where management recommendations from a generative artificial intelligence chatbot for patients with anal or colorectal cancers were compared against historical consensus decisions from multidisciplinary team meetings. SETTING: Single referral tertiary center. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients (mean age of 66.5 years; 53.5% woman) were included; 80% were primarily diagnosed with rectal cancer, predominantly stage II and III disease (46.6%). The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 4 cm. INTERVENTIONS: From a generative artificial intelligence chatbot, we generated management recommendations for each patient, which were subsequently compared to historical decisions from a multidisciplinary team to gauge concordance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included a degree of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the multidisciplinary team decisions, assessed on a scale from 1 (complete disagreement) to 5 (complete agreement), and justification was evaluated by 3 experienced colorectal surgeons. RESULTS: A generative artificial intelligence chatbot achieved a high concordance rate with multidisciplinary team decisions, with an average concordance rating of 4.08. Multidisciplinary team treatment strategies included neoadjuvant therapy for 33.3% of patients, upfront surgery for 26.6%, and further diagnostic assessment for 20%. Interrater agreement on concordance was found to be moderate (κ coefficient range, 0.333-0.577), whereas agreement on decision justification was slight (κ coefficient range, 0.047-0.094). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study with small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a high level of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the decisions from a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team, suggesting the potential of large language models to support clinical decision-making in the management of anal and colorectal cancers.  © The ASCRS 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Colorectal cancer; Large language models; Multidisciplinary team discussions","Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Care Team; Pilot Projects; adult; aged; anus cancer; Article; cancer staging; ChatGPT; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; female; generative artificial intelligence; health care; human; interrater reliability; large language model; male; managed care; multidisciplinary team; neoadjuvant therapy; outcome assessment; patient referral; pilot study; rectum cancer; retrospective study; very elderly; artificial intelligence; colorectal tumor; diagnosis; middle aged; organization and management; patient care team; therapy","","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206805288"

SoP is a crucial metric defining lithium-ion batteries’ power efficiency. Contrary to the State of Charge (SoC), the SoP assessment suggests the battery is being utilized under demanding conditions. This research introduces a new hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLstm) architectures. The predictive performance of the hybrid method is improved even further by utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter adjustment. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, are utilized to understand model predictions and determine the crucial factors influencing SoP. The predictive models underwent training and evaluation using a dataset from NASA, focusing on lithium-ion batteries. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model, incorporating PSO optimization, achieves exceptional accuracy. It yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.09, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.03, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.17, and an R2 value of 98%. Comparing these measures to individual models without PSO, there has been a noticeable improvement. The model's transparency and dependability are increased by using SHAP values, which provide a deep knowledge of the importance of features like battery voltage and current. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for significantly improving SoP predictions in BMS with the use of complex deep learning models optimized using PSO.

Herein, a hybrid intelligent framework for process parameter optimization of LPBF-ed Ti with improved ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) was proposed. It combines the data augmentation method (AVG ± EC × SD), the multi-model fusion stacking ensemble learning model (GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost), the interpretable machine learning method and the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ). The GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost outperforms single models in predicting UTS and EL across the accuracy, generalization ability and stability. The SHAP analysis reveals that laser power (P) is the most important feature affecting both UTS and EL, and it has a positive impact on them when P < 220 W. The UTS and EL of samples fabricated by the optimal process parameters were 718 ± 5 MPa and 27.9 % ± 0.1 %, respectively. The outstanding strength-ductility balance is attributable to the forward stresses in hard α’-martensite and back stresses in soft αm’-martensite induced by the strain gradients of hetero-microstructure. The back stresses strengthen the soft αm’-martensite, improving the overall UTS. The forward stresses stimulate the activation of dislocations in hard α’-martensite and the generation of 〈c + a〉 dislocations, allowing the plastic strain to occur in hard regions and enhancing the overall ductility. This work provides a feasible strategy for multi-objective optimization and valuable insights into tailoring the microstructure for improving mechanical properties. © 2025","Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; SHAP analysis; Titanium","Dislocations (crystals); Hydroelasticity; Layered manufacturing; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Titanium powder metallurgy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Powder bed; Property; SHAP analyze; Tensile elongation; Titania; Ultimate tensile strength; Tensile strength","","Chinese Society of Metals","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218415692"

This article introduces a novel LLM evolutionary algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates, and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel closed box metaheuristic optimization algorithms for box-constrained, continuous optimization problems automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and differential evolution) on the 5-D closed box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-D instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Automated code generation; evolutionary computation (EC); large language models (LLMs); metaheuristics; optimization","Automatic test pattern generation; Computational linguistics; Heuristic algorithms; Algorithm framework; Automated code generation; Automated generation; Complex codes; Language model; Large language model; Metaheuristic; Natural languages; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Constrained optimization","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003241288"

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary computation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based Evolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained great performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the properties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic search spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity measurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches, including FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal that while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its objective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo’s reflection mechanism yields good objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this finding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that maintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search algorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity indices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective. These results underscore the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation and understanding heuristic search spaces in designing frameworks in LLM-EPS.

We compare these responses to guidelines published for public consumption on the US Department of Homeland Security's Ready.gov website. We find that, although ChatGPT did not generate false or misleading responses, ChatGPT responses were typically less than optimal in terms of their similarity to guidances from the federal government. While delivered in an authoritative tone, these responses at times omitted important information and contained points of emphasis that were substantially different than those from Ready.gov.

The study also identifies the mediating influence of identification, true to Nigerian journalists’ expectations.

Among them, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is a powerful approach to generate molecules with desired physiochemical and pharmacological properties. However, the CVAE’s latent space is still a black-box, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the latent space and molecular properties. To address this issue, we propose the Interpretable Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE), which introduces a modified loss function that correlates the latent value with molecular properties. ICVAE established a linear mapping between latent variables and molecular properties. This linearity is not only crucial for improving interpretability, by assigning clear semantic meaning to latent dimensions, but also provides a practical advantage. It enables direct manipulation of molecular attributes through simple coordinate shifts in latent space, rather than relying on opaque, black-box optimization algorithms. Our experimental results show that the ICVAE can linearly relate one or multiple molecular properties with the latent value and generate molecules with precise properties by controlling the latent values. The ICVAE’s interpretability allows us to gain insight into the molecular generation process, making it a promising approach in drug discovery and material design. © 2025 by the authors.","drug discovery; molecular generation; variational autoencoder","Algorithms; Autoencoder; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Machine Learning; algorithm; article; autoencoder; drug development; generative model; human; machine learning; autoencoder; drug design; machine learning; procedures","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004891763"

Design/methodology/approach: Using a simplified case study of an international 3PL company, this study applies a GA developed in RStudio by LLM to generate test scenarios and input data.

These models have exhibited remarkable abilities in achieving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but the performance depends highly on the quality of prompting. Prompt engineering methods have been promoted for further extending the models' abilities to perform different applications. However, prompt engineering involves crafting input prompts for better accuracy and efficiency, demanding substantial expertise with trial-and-error effort. Automating the prompting process is important and can largely reduce human efforts in building suitable prompts. In this work, we develop a new metaheuristic algorithm to couple the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique and LLMs for prompt optimization. Our approach has some unique features: it can converge within only a small number of iterations (i.e., typically 10–20 iterations) to vastly reduce the expensive LLM usage cost; it can easily be applied to conduct many kinds of tasks owing to its simplicity and efficiency; and most importantly, it does not need to depend so much on the quality of initial prompts, because it can improve the prompts through learning more effectively based on enormous existing data. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments with several types of NLP datasets and compared them to others. The results highlight the importance of coupling metaheuristic search algorithms and LLMs for prompt optimization, proving that the presented approach can be adopted to enhance the performance of LLMs. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ChatGPT; large language model; machine learning; particle swarm optimization; prompt optimization","ChatGPT; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Prompt optimization; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004212189"

Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs.

Machine learning can significantly accelerate the discovery and design process of new materials. However, as the number of elements in the alloy and target performance metrics increase, alloy optimization becomes more challenging. To address this, this paper proposes a machine learning–based multi-objective optimization method for magnesium alloy fracturing balls. The machine learning model trained on the magnesium alloy corrosion and ultimate compressive strength database achieves an accuracy of 0.98 on the training set and 0.93 on the test set. By using a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the element ratios of the magnesium alloy, Mg-6.4Al-3.4Zn-4.6Cu was obtained, with a corrosion rate of 538 mm/year and an ultimate compressive strength of 369 MPa.

It also explored how proficiency level of learners mediated the successful use of the target form. Sixty Turkish EFL learners were employed and distributed into three groups: reformulations (n = 20), elicitations (n = 20), and control (n = 20). During the online delivery of courses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the learners met their instructors synchronously outside class times over a period of five weeks for the administration of the treatment and data collection. To prompt the use of the target linguistic structure, the researcher developed an oral production task. The immediate learner uptake measures and pretest-posttest results were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of both feedback strategies. The analysis comparing the measure of learner uptake indicated a greater number of successful corrections for reformulations. The data from the pretest-posttest measures also suggested that the reformulations group outperformed the elicitations and control group. It was also revealed that the proficiency level of learners had a mediating role only for reformulations.

Objectives: To evaluate patisiran efficacy and safety in post hoc analysis of the Brazilian subpopulation of APOLLO-B. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) in functional capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included CFB to Month 12 in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. Exploratory endpoints included CFB in cardiac biomarkers and Perugini grade of cardiac uptake during technetium-99m scintigraphy. Results: Forty-two patients enrolled in Brazil (patisiran, n=20; placebo, n=22). Patisiran showed benefit in 6MWT and KCCQ-OS scores vs. placebo; CFB (95% confidence interval [CI]) in 6MWT (median) and KCCQ-OS scores (least squares mean) was –2.0 m (–58.5, 42.9) and 9.37 (1.93, 16.81) points with patisiran vs. –30.1 m (–72.2, 3.5) and 2.62 (–4.68, 9.92) points for placebo. For cardiac biomarkers, the mean fold-change from baseline (95% CI) for N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I was 1.31 (1.06, 1.61) and 1.12 (0.94, 1.34) for patisiran, and 1.71 (1.39, 2.10) and 1.28 (1.08, 1.53) for placebo, respectively. Perugini grade improved in 11/18 (61.1%) and 0/10 evaluable patients with patisiran and placebo, respectively. There were no deaths in the patisiran group vs. 3 in the placebo group. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of patisiran in Brazilian patients with ATTR-CM in APOLLO-B were consistent with those in the global study population.

They serve to examine a system’s structure (e.g., what concepts are critical to spreading an intervention’s effects?) and long-term behavior (e.g., if we increase fruit availability, how will its consumption change?). When modelers build FCMs by leveraging participants’ knowledge, the resulting participant-built FCMs can be analyzed and interpreted since participants report perceived causality. However, engaging enough knowledgeable participants to construct an FCM can be challenging. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms derive FCMs from data by selecting relationships to maximize a metric such as accuracy, which can produce overly dense FCMs where relationships may not represent valid causal mechanisms—this hinders the critically important interpretability of FCMs. In this paper, we address the need for expert knowledge and the validity of causal mechanisms in FCMs. Specifically, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide algorithms in building FCMs where valid pairs of concepts are connected in the right causal direction and with the correct causal type (increase/decrease). Our approach combines LLMs with CMA-ES, a ubiquitous, state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm. Using three real-world case studies and several LLMs, we show our method successfully (i) learns sparse FCMs that fit the data well and (ii) represents valid causal relationships. Moreover, the learned FCMs are sparser than the corresponding participant-built ones, demonstrating our method may help simplify existing FCMs and selectively includes causal relationships, which is essential to build trustworthy and interpretable FCMs. © The Author(s) 2025.","CMA-ES; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Large language models","Adversarial machine learning; Digital elevation model; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Causal relationships; CMA-ES; Cognitive maps; Language model; Large language model; Learn+; Relationship between concepts; S effect; Simulation model; Weighted digraph; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000464383"

Traditional in vivo methods for determining OP toxicity are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we developed a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict acute rat toxicity of OPs using two-dimensional molecular and quantum chemical descriptors, optimized through genetic algorithm-based multiple linear regression (GA-MLR). The optimal model demonstrated robust performance with the following statistical parameters: coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7451, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) coefficient (Q2Loo) of 0.6208, external test set coefficient of determination (R2ext) of 0.7360. These metrics indicate excellent generalization and predictive capabilities of the model. Interpretative analysis of the model revealed that NumHDonors and PEOE_VSA were the most significant descriptors influencing OP toxicity. An increase in hydrogen bond donors within OP molecules reduces toxicity, as these donors enhance hydrophilicity, diminishing membrane permeability. Moreover, the PEOE_VSA descriptor characterizes the partial charge properties of OP molecules, reflecting their electrostatic interactions with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) during binding, which influences toxicity. This study presents an optimized modeling strategy designed for small datasets, enabling stable feature selection and accurate assessment of their contributions to toxicity prediction. This research provides a reliable QSAR approach for OP toxicity prediction while offering new insights into toxicity mechanisms. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","acute toxicity; machine learning; molecular descriptors; multiple linear regression; Organophosphates; QSAR","Administration, Oral; Algorithms; Animals; Linear Models; Male; Organophosphates; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Multiple linear regression; Prediction models; Toxicity; organophosphate; Acute toxicity; Coefficient of determination; Descriptors; Machine-learning; Molecular descriptors; Multiple linear regressions; Organophosphate; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling; Toxicity predictions; detection method; hydrogen; multiple regression; organophosphate; toxicity; algorithm; animal; chemistry; male; oral drug administration; procedures; quantitative structure activity relation; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; statistical model; toxicity testing; Hydrogen bonds","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004067409"

This study aims to optimize the energy efficiency, specifically the Coefficient of Performance (COP), of solar-powered absorption cooling systems using advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. For this purpose, predictive models employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were developed. Subsequently, nature-inspired optimization techniques, including Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were explored to improve the prediction skills. The study utilized three distinct feature combinations to capture various operational and environmental parameters, and the models were evaluated using several statistical metrics. The results demonstrated significant improvements in predictive accuracy with the optimized models. Combination 1 (C1) achieved near-perfect goodness-of-fit values with marginal gains from optimization, while Combination 2 (C2) also showed high values with slight reductions in the optimized models. Similarly, Combination 3 (C3) initially had lower performance. Still, optimization techniques notably improved the goodness-of-fit values, with ANN-CSO showing an 11.46 % increase, ANN-MFOA a 10.36 % increase, and ANN-WOA a 10.54 % increase. Further feature importance using SHAP analysis indicated that the most influential parameters were heat absorption (Qa), heat exchange rate (Qe), cooling capacity (Qc), and heat dissipation (Qd), with solar irradiance (Ir) having a minor impact. These findings indicate that the optimization techniques are particularly effective for feature sets that initially underperform. The study recommends integrating these advanced optimization methods into the design and operation of solar-powered absorption cooling systems to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Future research should explore the scalability and adaptability of these optimized models across different climatic regions, incorporate real-time data, and investigate the economic and long-term stability aspects under various operational scenarios to ensure comprehensive practical implementation and sustainability benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The model, for the first time, predicts discharge-coup-de-fouet phenomenon and its features using non-nucleation mechanism. It attempts to resolve long-standing ambiguity over origin of the phenomenon by providing alternative explanation for it based on availability of the active surface area. The model also provides different interpretation for limited capacity utilization of the active mass during the discharge cycle. Finally, based on the model predictions, controlling mechanisms for different regions of the battery discharge characteristics are identified. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Discharge coup-de-fouet phenomenon; Lead–acid battery; Modeling and simulation; State-of-charge","Electric corona; Lead acid batteries; Coup de fouet; Discharge characteristics; Discharge coup-de-fouet phenomenon; Ion-transport; Lead-acid battery; Limited capacity; Model and simulation; Modelling studies; Simulation studies; States of charges; State of charge","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003741814"

We sought to evaluate their deployment in anesthesiology and critical care in a systematic review. Our aim was to describe the integration of LLMs in the field by showcasing and categorizing their current applications, assessing their performance in patient care, and reviewing application-specific ethical and practical challenges in deployment. Methods: Respecting Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically searched through PubMed®, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science®, from inception until 1 August 2024. We extracted all papers investigating LLMs in anesthesiology or critical care and reporting results. We segmented the literature into major themes and highlighted key findings and limitations. Results: From 480 retrieved articles, we included 45 papers. The evaluated models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Google Bard [now Gemini], LLaMA, and others) showed diverse applications in four segments: intensive care unit, patient education, medical education, and perioperative care. Large language models, especially newer models, are promising in predicting clinical scores, navigating simple clinical scenarios, and managing preoperative anxiety. Their performance remains below the clinician level in predicting outcomes, solving complex clinical scenarios (i.e., airway management), board examinations, and generating patient-directed documents, although newer models performed better than older ones. Conclusion: While LLMs are not yet equipped to fully assist physicians in anesthesiology and critical care, they have significant potential, and their capabilities are rapidly improving. Supervised use for select tasks can streamline patient care. Further trials are warranted as new versions of models become available.

This study takes Lanxi City as an example and comprehensively considers soil formation factors such as climate, vegetation, and terrain. Based on the genetic algorithm, 47 environmental variables are combined and optimized to construct a random forest (RF) model and an improved version—a random forest model based on genetic algorithm variable combination optimization (RF-GA). At the same time, the SHAP interpretation method is used to quantitatively analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOM content and further identify the main driving factors. Compared with the ordinary Kriging (OK) and random forest (RF) methods, the random forest model based on genetic algorithm variable combination optimization (RF-GA) demonstrates a significantly improved prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.49; RMSE = 3.49 g·kg−1), with an MAE = 3.019 and LCCC = 0.67. Among the three models, the R2 of the RF-GA model increases by 87.84% and 56.29%. The model prediction results indicate that the SOM content in the study area ranges from 12.11 to 31.38 g·kg−1, showing spatial distribution characteristics of a higher content in mountainous areas and a lower content in plains. A further SHAP analysis shows that terrain, climate, and biological factors are key environmental factors affecting the spatial differentiation of the SOM, with the channel network base level (CNBL), which contributes 20.68% to the model, and DEM, which has a contribution rate of 5.57%, playing particularly significant roles. By regulating moisture, erosion deposition, vegetation distribution, and microclimate conditions, they significantly affect the spatial distribution of the SOM. In summary, the RF-GA and its interpretable prediction model constructed in this study not only effectively reveal the spatial and driving mechanisms of SOM in hilly and basin areas but also provide a solid theoretical basis and practical guidance for accurate mapping, the formulation of sustainable utilization strategies for soil resources, and ensuring national food security. © 2025 by the authors.","genetic algorithm; random forest; SHAP; soil organic matter","Forest ecology; Interpolation; Random forests; Basin area; Combination optimization; Distribution characteristics; Driving mechanism; Hilly areas; Model-based OPC; Random forest modeling; Random forests; SHAP; Soil organic matters; Genetic algorithms","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002277409"

Phase prediction of HEA coatings presents a formidable challenge due to the non-equilibrium solidification characteristics inherent in laser cladding and the intricate influence of substrate variables. This study employs machine learning (ML), leveraging a dataset of 513 HEAs, to explore phase formation and stability in coatings. The dilution rate and carbon equivalent are introduced as input features that encapsulate the processing nuances of laser cladding. Simulated annealing algorithm and over-sampling method are used to optimize the ML model. The predicted outcomes for 10 unexplored HEA phases closely align with experimental results from laser cladding experiments. Utilizing the SHAP (Shapley Additional Explanations) model, the importance of input features is elucidated, identifying valence electron concentration (VEC) as the most influential. Data analysis further probes the solid solution formation capability of HEA coatings, establishing the following criteria: for single BCC phase, VEC is less than 7.4 and δ is less than 7.63; for single FCC phase, VEC is greater than 7.5 and δ is less than 7.46; and for dual-phase BCC + FCC structure, VEC ranges from 7.2 to 7.8 and δ spans 2.5 to 8.24. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","High-entropy alloy; Laser cladding; Machine learning; Optimization algorithm; Phase prediction","Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Laser cladding; Alloy coatings; High entropy alloys; Input features; Laser clad; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic optimization; Non-equilibrium solidification; Optimization algorithms; Phase prediction; Valence electron concentration; Simulated annealing","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212347259"

Recently, large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, have emerged as a promising method for handling natural language texts. However, LLMs are too dependent on elaborate prompts, resulting in extensive expert knowledge and manual prompt templates needed. In this work, we propose a novel method for the automatic prompt design, called Particle Swarm Optimization-based Prompt using a Large language model (PSOPL). As an efficient method for medical information extraction from EHRs, PSOPL can allow particle swarm optimization (PSO) to automate design prompts by leveraging LLM's ability to generate coherent text token-by-token. Specifically, starting with a small number of initial prompts, evolutionary operators in PSOPL guide the LLM to generate new candidate prompts iteratively, and the PSOPL evaluates population fitness to retain the optimal prompts. In this way, PSOPL can achieve prompt evolution without model training and reduce the human effort and requirement for domain knowledge. We conducted experiments for open-source LLMs (e.g., Alpaca-7B, GPT-J-6B) and closed-source LLM (e.g., GLM-4), on public medical datasets (e.g., CMeEE, CMeIE, CHIP-CDEE) covering information extraction tasks (e.g., named Entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction) to verify the method's generalizability. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of using PSO-based LLMs to design prompts automatically, allowing for the swift extraction of important information about patients in the EHRs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic health record; Information extraction; Large language model; Particle swarm optimization; Prompt design","Natural language processing systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Electronic health; Health records; Information extraction; Language model; Large language model; Medical information; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Prompt design; Swarm optimization; Electronic health record","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002659881"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the level of inferior mesenteric artery ligation on blood flow to the anastomotic site and the incidence of anastomotic leakage using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of the EssentiAL trial. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at 41 tertiary referral centers in Japan. PATIENTS: A total of 839 patients with rectal cancer (<12 cm from the anal verge) were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of anastomotic leakage and perfusion status were compared between the high and low ligation groups. RESULTS: The median fluorescence time was similar at 25 seconds in both groups (p = 0.74). Although no statistical difference was noted, the high ligation group was more likely to have greater outliers in fluorescence time compared to the low ligation group. The high ligation group demonstrated higher poor perfusion rates than the low ligation group (2.8% vs 1.5%). In the high ligation group, anastomotic leakage occurred in 1 case of poor perfusion where additional resection was not performed by the surgeon’s intraoperative judgment. In addition, the additional resection rate nearly doubled with the use of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. After propensity score matching (129 patients per group), the overall anastomotic leakage rate was 13.2% in the high ligation group and 10.9% in the low ligation group (p = 0.57). LIMITATIONS: This study was a post hoc analysis, the sample size was small, and the anastomosis methods varied. CONCLUSIONS: The level of inferior mesenteric artery ligation did not affect blood flow at the anastomotic site or the incidence of anastomotic leakage statistically, but assessing bowel perfusion using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging can offer clinical benefits, optimizing patient outcomes.

LLMs could also be used for diagnosis and treatment. National antibiotic prescribing guidelines are customized and informed by local laboratory data on antimicrobial resistance. Methods: Based on 24 vignettes with information on type of infection, gender, age group and comorbidities, GPs and LLMs were prompted to provide a treatment. Four countries (Ireland, UK, USA and Norway) were included and a GP from each country and six LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Mistral AI, Claude and Llama 3.1) were provided with the vignettes, including their location (country). Responses were compared with the country’s national prescribing guidelines. In addition, limitations of LLMs such as hallucination, toxicity and data leakage were assessed. Results: GPs’ answers to the vignettes showed high accuracy in relation to diagnosis (96%–100%) and yes/no antibiotic prescribing (83%–92%). GPs referenced (100%) and prescribed (58%–92%) according to national guidelines, but dose/duration of treatment was less accurate (50%–75%). Overall, the GPs’ accuracy had a mean of 74%. LLMs scored high in relation to diagnosis (92%–100%), antibiotic prescribing (88%–100%) and the choice of antibiotic (59%–100%) but correct referencing often failed (38%–96%), in particular for the Norwegian guidelines (0%–13%). Data leakage was shown to be an issue as personal information was repeated in the models’ responses to the vignettes. Conclusions: LLMs may be safe to guide antibiotic prescribing in general practice. However, to interpret vignettes, apply national guidelines and prescribe the right dose and duration, GPs remain best placed. © The Author(s) 2025.

The resulting hybrid method, tested in the context of a social network-based combinatorial optimization problem, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with MHs regarding the obtained solution quality.

Design/methodology/approach: Forum posts from students enrolled in nine MOOCs were redacted by three human reviewers. The GPT and Llama models were then tasked with de-identifying the same data set using standardized prompts. Discrepancies between LLM and human redactions were analyzed to identify patterns in LLM errors. Findings: All models achieved an average recall of over 0.9 in identifying PII and identified PII instances overlooked by humans. However, their precisions were lower – 0.579 for GPT-4o, 0.506 for Llama 3.3 and 0.262 for Llama 3.1 – showing a tendency to over-redact non-PII names and locations. Research limitations/implications: Several courses’ data were analyzed to increase findings’ generalizability but the models’ performance may vary in other contexts. GPT and Llama models were selected because of their availability and cost-effectiveness at the time of the study; future newer models may improve performance. Practical implications: The use of downloadable LLMs enables researchers to de-identify data without training specialized models or involving external companies, ensuring that student data remains private. Originality/value: Previous research on LLM text de-identification has largely used proprietary models, which require sharing data containing sensitive PII with third-party companies. This study evaluates the performance of two open weight models that can be deployed locally, eliminating the need to share sensitive data externally. © 2025, Andres Felipe Zambrano, Shreya Singhal, Maciej Pankiewicz, Ryan Shaun Baker, Chelsea Porter and Xiner Liu.","Anonymization; De-identification; GPT; Large language models; Llama; Massively open online course; Privacy","","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002376885"

Extensive research has been conducted on the theoretical simulation of such systems. The novelty of this work is to explore the potential of explainable artificial intelligence in improving the design and optimization of the double-skin solar chimney. The need for this research is owing to the high computational limitations of the physical model of such systems, thus the application of explainable artificial intelligence based upon artificial neural network can address this research gap. The paper solved a validated physical model and demonstrates the suitability of artificial neural network twins as computational-efficient subrogates that can be later used by a multiobjective optimization function to find the optimal design values for the facades of double-skin buildings. The results of the comparison between the physical and the artificial neural network model show the practical advantage of utilizing the digital twin model without compromising accuracy. The results have indicated that the artificial neural network can achieve a high coefficient of determination ranging from 0.921 to 0.999 on different performance indicators that implies a high goodness of fit. Accordingly, the optimization study based upon a nonsorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has indicated a high ventilation rate of 2.86 1/h and an efficiency of 37.21%. The insights of this work have reflected that exploring the societal implications of sustainable building technologies such as the double facade solar chimney through educational initiatives can cultivate a new generation of society who not only understand the technical aspects but also appreciate the broader social and environmental contexts of their work, eventually to have future buildings with integrated passive systems. © The Author(s) 2025.

Adulteration of red chilli with brick powder is a significant food safety issue as it poses serious health risks to consumers. Accurate identification of the adulteration presents a significant challenge, particularly when adulteration is present in minuscule amounts. Existing methods aimed at identifying such micro levels of food adulteration are less accurate and lack interpretability. This study aims to address the research gaps in food adulteration by developing a robust model that integrates machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence methods. The key contributions of the proposed work are a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to enhance the model performance in limited data scenarios; improved particle swarm optimization as a promising metaheuristic optimization method to select the robust and highly discriminative features and to address premature convergence; explainable artificial intelligence methods (SHAP and LIME) to enhance the ensemble stacking model transparency and interpretability. A custom dataset is generated in the work, and it comprises 250 natural samples distributed among 5 categories (50 samples per category), ranging from no adulteration to adulteration in varying concentrations of 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 4 %, respectively. The proposed work is implemented on the synthetic data (200 samples per category) generated by the deep convolutional generative adversarial network. The potent combination of improved particle swarm optimization and explainable artificial intelligence enhances the accuracy, interpretability, and transparency of the proposed model by providing deeper insights which in turn bolsters confidence in distinguishing between pure and adulterated red chilli powder samples, thus contributing to improved food safety measures. The proposed model has shown a remarkable accuracy of 92.42 % on the synthetic data. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Ensemble Stacking Classification; Explainable AI; Feature Extraction; Improved Particle Swarm Optimization; Red Chilli Adulteration","","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001854962"

However, these models often lack interpretability and transparency, which hinders their accessibility for both researchers and practitioners. In response to this challenge, this study explores the utilization of Genetic Programming (GP) to bridge the existing research gap between high predictive accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models. Unlike black-box models, GP allows for the development of simplified closed-form liquefaction prediction models that provide clear insights into the underlying relationships between soil properties and liquefaction potential. By automatically generating and evolving mathematical expressions, GP offers a transparent and interpretable approach that enhances the understanding of the factors influencing liquefaction. This study validates the proposed GP model against existing models in the literature to ascertain its effectiveness and reliability.

Traditional HPO methods require substantial evaluations to search for superior configurations. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches leverage domain knowledge and few-shot learning proficiency to discover promising configurations with minimal human effort. However, the repetition issues causes LLMs to generate configurations similar to context examples, which may confine the optimization process to local regions. Moreover, since LLMs rely on the examples they generate for a few-shot learning, a self-reinforcing loop is formed, hindering LLMs from escaping local optima. In this work, we propose EvoContext, which aims to intentionally generate configurations that differ significantly from examples via external interventions and actively breaks the self-reinforcing effect for a more efficient approximation of the global optimum. Our EvoContext method involves two phases: (i) initial example generation through cold or warm starting and (ii) iterative optimization that integrates genetic operations for updating examples to enhance global exploration capabilities. Additionally, it employs LLMs in-context learning to generate configurations based on competitive examples for local refinement. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that EvoContext outperforms traditional and other LLM-driven approaches on HPO. © 2025 by the authors.","few-shot learning; genetic algorithm; hyperparameter optimization; large language model","Reinforcement learning; Domain knowledge; Few-shot learning; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Model based approach; Optimization capabilities; Optimization method; Self reinforcing; Genetic algorithms","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007792388"

By optimizing two ensemble machine learning models (Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) using three physically based metaheuristic algorithms (Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (ArchOA), Chernobyl Disaster Optimizer (CDO), and Simulated Annealing (SA)), the study demonstrated the potential of this approach to improve the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps significantly. This research employed an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, namely SHAP (SHapley Additive explanations), to interpret developed models. Additionally, an uncertainty quantification approach was utilized to assess the reliability of susceptibility maps. The landslide susceptibility map was prepared using 153 landslide occurrence points and 15 effective criteria on landslides in Khalkhal town of Iran. The results revealed that XGBoost-CDO, XGBoost-ArchOA, RF-CDO, XGBoost-SA, XGBoost, RF-SA, and RF models, respectively, were the most accurate, with the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values of 0.952, 0.958, 0.951, 0.938, 0.929, 0.847, and 0.842. The results of the uncertainty map showed that areas with higher landslide susceptibility have lower uncertainty, with 65.35% of all landslides occurring in regions characterized by high landslide susceptibility and lower uncertainty. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Landslide prediction; Machine learning; Spatial modeling; Uncertainty analysis","Iran; Contrastive Learning; Decision trees; Machine learning; Mapping; Random forests; Chernobyl; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Landslide prediction; Landslide susceptibility; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Random forests; Spatial modelling; Uncertainty; algorithm; landslide; machine learning; mapping; prediction; spatial data; uncertainty analysis; Adversarial machine learning","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218064770"

Optimizing these parameters is essential for ensuring consistent weld quality and improving overall efficiency. As the dimensionality of process parameters and sample sizes increase, the relationship between process parameters and BTS becomes increasingly complex, uncertain, and nonlinear. While machine learning (ML) techniques struggle to handle this complexity, deep learning (DL) methods, although effective at capturing nonlinear patterns, are constrained by their lack of interpretability, limiting their wider application in industrial environments. To address these challenges, an intrinsically and post-hoc interpretable approach combining the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. An LDPW experimental platform is first established, employing an orthogonal design (L81) with five factors at three levels to gather datasets. A lightweight and interpretable KAN with a single hidden layer is then developed to establish the nonlinear relationship between process parameters and BTS. During optimization, the trained KAN serves as a surrogate model to define decision variables, constraints, and objective functions, with interpretability enhanced through graphical and symbolic representations that clarify how process parameters impact the BTS. Furthermore, the post-hoc Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is employed to provide global and local insight into the overall and sample-specific influence on BTS. Validation of the optimization results confirms that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm (GA); Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN); laser deep penetration welding (LDPW); process parameters optimization (PPO); Shapley additive explanation (SHAP)","Deep learning; Deep penetration; Laser welding machines; Orthogonal functions; Genetic algorithm; Kolmogorov; Kolmogorov-arnold network; Laser deep penetration welding; Process parameter optimization; Process parameters; Process parameters optimizations; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Genetic algorithms","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001859219"

The implications of de-extinction for restoration ecology greatly depend on the type of species that is resurrected. Several guidelines have been developed that propose selection criteria based on their positive ecological impact. Little is known, however, about how people actually make the choice for a particular species, and whether those guidelines are followed in practice. We systematically investigated what motives play a role in selecting candidate species for de-extinction through the analysis of 18 interviews and 128 online sources on selection processes for ongoing de-extinction projects worldwide. We found that candidate species for de-extinction are selected for a variety of reasons, including non-ecological reasons like animal charisma and personal fascination. We analyse these results using a relational framework from the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) that explains priority setting in research by looking at the relations between researchers with funders, users, and public values. We demonstrate that in the case of de-extinction, these relations create an environment in which charismatic species are structurally favoured, possibly at the expense of more ecologically sound species. This complements approaches in evolutionary psychology that explain the endurance of animal charisma by focusing on emotional responses in individuals who are triggered by animals with a ‘cuddle factor’. We argue that even if individuals are able to overcome such emotional triggers, animal charisma as selection criteria will endure because the relations between different actors structurally favour the selection of charismatic species. © The Author(s) 2025.","charismatic species; conservation technology; De-extinction; restoration ecology; resurrection biology; species selection","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002264540"

The study aimed to profile a sample of IBD patients about the relationship between PA-partner status and social network support. Patients and methods: A post hoc analysis of the “BE-FIT-IBD” study was set up by stratifying the data of PA with that of partner status and the support that the patient's social network (i.e., relatives, friends) provided in inciting the patient to practice regular PA. Results: In the 219 patients included, there was a greater tendency for patients with stable partners to view the risk of reactivation/worsening of IBD as a barrier to conducting regular PA (p < 0.0001). Single patients considered PA more as a protective factor (p = 0.045). Patients without a PA-supporting social network retained IBD-related treatment as a PA barrier (p = 0.016) and PA as a risk for IBD complications (p = 0.01), with less confidence that PA could improve the course of IBD (p < 0.001). Rectal syndrome was an IBD-related barrier more represented in patients with PA-deterring social network (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: These factors are potential targets for recovering the IBD patient's adherence to regular PA. © 2024 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Inflammatory bowel disease; IPAQ; Partner; Physical activity; Quality of life; Social support","Adult; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Exercise; Female; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Social Support; Spouses; biological product; adult; Article; Crohn disease; cross-sectional study; domestic partner; female; friend; gastroenterologist; human; inflammatory bowel disease; international physical activity questionnaire; major clinical study; male; observational study; patient empowerment; physical activity; post hoc analysis; quality of life; relative; social network; social support; sport; stratified sample; ulcerative colitis; complication; Crohn disease; exercise; inflammatory bowel disease; middle aged; psychology; spouse; ulcerative colitis","","Ediciones Doyma, S.L.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194906883"

Developing a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for efficient and accurate CKD detection is vital to enhancing diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to develop an interpretable CAD system that not only achieves high prediction accuracy but also provides insights into the factors influencing these predictions, aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making. We applied random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and XGBoost (XGB) classifiers to a UCI CKD dataset containing 400 samples and 24 attributes, addressing missing values with K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation. To enhance model performance, we employed a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection and utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpretability. The classifiers achieved accuracies of 98.33%, 95.83%, 98.33%, and 99.17% for RF, DT, LR, and XGB, respectively, using all features. Feature selection with the Genetic Algorithm improved accuracy to 99.17% for both RF and LR, while DT accuracy increased to 97.50%, and XGBoost’s accuracy remained at 99.17%. SHAP analysis identified serum creatinine, hemoglobin, specific gravity, and albumin as the most influential features in CKD prediction. These findings demonstrate that the developed CAD system meets the study’s aims by offering high predictive accuracy alongside critical interpretability, enabling informed clinical decisions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Chronic kidney disease; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning; SHAP","","","Springer Nature","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212129949"

Accurately estimating porosity is crucial for reservoir characterization, well planning, and production optimization in the oil and gas industry. Traditional porosity determination methods, such as porosimetry, geostatistical, and core analysis, often involve complex geological and geophysical models, which are expensive and time-consuming. This study used the integrated machine learning and optimization model of differential evolution (DE) with group method of data handling (GMDH-DE) to estimate the porosity using integrated well log and core data from the Mpyo oil field, Uganda. The GMDH-DE demonstrates superior performance compared with conventional GMDH, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9925 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0017 during training, an R2 of 0.9845 with an RMSE of 0.0121 during testing, and when validated the R2 was 0.9825 with RMSE of 0.00018. A key novelty of this work is the integration of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which provides an interpretable analysis of the model’s input features. SHAP reveals that bulk density (RHOB) and neutron porosity (NPHI) are the most critical parameters for porosity estimation, offering valuable insight into features importance. The proposed GMDH-DE model and SHAP analysis represent a novel and independent approach for accurate porosity estimation and interpretability, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of hydrocarbon exploration and development.

Existing research usually used predefined models to explain the relationship between the weight and the length of crabs. In this paper, we propose an effective regression method using genetic programming (GP) to build explainable models, which include more features to explore potential relationships between the weight and the physical features of crabs. The GP-based method has been evaluated on a publicly available dataset of crabs. The experimental results were compared with several baseline methods for predicting two kinds of crab weights. GP shows the best performance among all the baseline methods on the test set, i.e., 90.8% for predicting the weight of crabs and 81.3% for predicting the shucked weight of crabs in terms of coefficient of determination. Thanks to the explicit ability of feature selection, GP can select more important features to improve the prediction performance. More importantly, the generated models can provide potential interpretability, which is particularly valuable for domain experts in fisheries management and ecological research. © 2025 The Authors","Crab; Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic programming; Symbolic regression; Weight prediction","artificial intelligence; crab; data set; genetic analysis; numerical model; regression analysis; weight","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002859386"

The RC denotes a failure to infer bidirectional relationships that undermines logical reasoning capabilities. Under the RC, LLMs are unable to infer bidirectional relationships effectively leading to logical errors in deductive reasoning. If a model is trained on a sentence of the form “A relates to B”, it does not automatically generalize to the reverse form, “B relates to A”. Through a systematic literature review and experimental analysis, we highlight the difficulties in maintaining causal coherence in state-of-the-art LLMs. Recognizing the RC as a persistent problem across architectures, we review mitigation strategies including data augmentation and innovative training objectives to offer valuable insights into the root causes and discuss their limitations.

By integrating a lightweight LSTM-attention neural network as the denoiser within a diffusion framework, PPD offers an innovative and efficient approach to polypeptide generation. Evaluations demonstrate that the PPD model can generate diverse and novel polypeptide sequences across various testing conditions, achieving high pLDDT scores when folded by ESMFold. In comparison to the ProteinDiffusionGenerator B (PDG-B) model, a relevant benchmark in the field, PPD exhibits the ability to produce longer and more diverse polypeptide sequences. This improvement is attributed to PPD’s optimized architecture and expanded training dataset, which enhance its understanding of protein structural pattern.

Large language models may serve as an accessible method to improve patient educational material. The aim of this study was to compare readability between existing educational materials and those generated by large language models. Methods: Baseline colorectal surgery educational materials were gathered from a large academic institution (n = 52). Three prompts were entered into Perplexity and ChatGPT 3.5 for each topic: a Basic prompt that simply requested patient educational information the topic, an Iterative prompt that repeated instruction asking for the information to be more health literate, and a Metric-based prompt that requested a sixth-grade reading level, short sentences, and short words. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level or Grade Level, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease or Ease, and Modified Grade Level scores were calculated for all materials, and unpaired t tests were used to compare mean scores between baseline and documents generated by artificial intelligence platforms. Results: Overall existing materials were longer than materials generated by the large language models across categories and prompts: 863–956 words vs 170–265 (ChatGPT) and 220–313 (Perplexity), all P < .01. Baseline materials did not meet sixth-grade readability guidelines based on grade level (Grade Level 7.0–9.8 and Modified Grade Level 9.6–11.5) or ease of readability (Ease 53.1–65.0). Readability of materials generated by a large language model varied by prompt and platform. Overall, ChatGPT materials were more readable than baseline materials with the Metric-based prompt: Grade Level 5.2 vs 8.1, Modified Grade Level 7.3 vs 10.3, and Ease 70.5 vs 60.4, all P < .01. In contrast, Perplexity-generated materials were significantly less readable except for those generated with the Metric-based prompt, which did not statistically differ. Conclusion: Both existing materials and the majority of educational materials created by large language models did not meet readability recommendations. The exception to this was with ChatGPT materials generated with a Metric-based prompt that consistently improved readability scores from baseline and met recommendations in terms of the average Grade Level score. The variability in performance highlights the importance of the prompt used with large language models. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","","Colorectal Surgery; Comprehension; Health Literacy; Humans; Language; Patient Education as Topic; Reading; Teaching Materials; Article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; colon biopsy; colorectal patient; colorectal surgery; electronic medical record; engineering; human; large language model; ostomy; patient; patient education; prompt engineering; reading; sigmoidoscopy; comparative study; comprehension; education; educational material; health literacy; language; procedures","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214096430"

In this paper, an advanced deep learning model integrating Explainable Vision Transformer (EViT) architecture with Selective Kernel Learning (SKL) and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) method has been proposed. The EViT model utilizes the capability of vision transformer by incorporating SKL method for dynamic selection of optimal kernels to enhance the feature extraction. This process also improves the identification of relevant patterns and structures in the tissue samples. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using MODE algorithm to improve the model's efficiency and interpretability. For preprocessing the input histopathological images of colon cancer non-local mean filtering method is used enabling precise path extraction and feature embeddings. By incorporating MODE algorithm for hyperparameter optimization balancing accuracy and reliability ensuring better efficiency of the model. The explainability of the model is facilitated by using Gradient Weighted Class Average Mapping (GRAD-CAM) and attention maps to improve decision making process.

However, recent research has explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising alternative. This paper introduces TreeC, a machine learning method that utilises the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy metaheuristic algorithm to generate an interpretable EMS modelled as a decision tree. Unlike RBC and MPC approaches, TreeC learns the decision strategy of the EMS based on historical data, adapting the control model to the controlled energy grid. The decision strategy is represented as a decision tree, providing interpretability compared to RL methods that often rely on black-box models like neural networks. TreeC is evaluated against MPC with perfect forecast and RL EMSs in two case studies taken from literature: an electric grid case and a household heating case. In the electric grid case, TreeC achieves an average energy loss and constraint violation score of 19.2, which is close to MPC and RL EMSs that achieve scores of 14.4 and 16.2 respectively. All three methods control the electric grid well especially when compared to the random EMS, which obtains an average score of 12 875.

Although Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristics (GPHH) have demonstrated strong adaptability to such uncertainties by evolving dynamic routing policies, their complex decision-making processes hinder interpretability. To address this, a novel framework called Differential Evolution with Random Ablation (DERA) is introduced to generate diverse and feasible counterfactual explanations. Unlike traditional methods, DERA systematically explores multiple counterfactual scenarios by integrating random ablation into the optimisation process, thereby uncovering a broader range of plausible alternatives. Experimental results across various UCARP instances show that DERA consistently achieves high feasibility, minimal feature changes, and greater diversity in counterfactual explanations compared to baseline methods. This diversity enables a more comprehensive understanding of GPHH-evolved policies, providing actionable insights to improve decision-making transparency and robustness in dynamic environments.  © 2025 IEEE.","","Decision making; Dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Capacitated arc routing problem; Counterfactuals; Differential Evolution; Hyper-heuristics; Real-world; Service costs; Stochastics; Task demand; Uncertainty; Waste collection; Ablation","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010426787"

In this study, a random forest (RF) model is employed as a baseline predictive tool for estimating peak outflow. To enhance its predictive performance, Squirrel search algorithm (SSA), Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), and Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) are integrated to optimize the model hyperparameters. A dataset comprising 128 documented dam failure cases is augmented to train and test prediction models. The results demonstrate that the SSA-RF model trained on the augmented dataset achieve outstanding predictive accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9999, root mean square error (RMSE) of 56.693, mean absolute error (MAE) of 23.935, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.105, variance accounted for (VAF) of 99.986 %, and A-20 index of 0.924 on the test set. Furthermore, several model interpretability techniques are employed to evaluate the influence of input variables on the predictions. The results indicate that the height of water above the breach (Hw) and the reservoir storage volume above the breach (Vw) are the most critical factors influencing peak outflow predictions. This study provides a novel perspective based on artificial intelligence for peak outflow's prediction and assessment of dam failure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Dam failure; Metaheuristic algorithm; Model interpretability; Peak outflow; Random Forest","Artificial intelligence; Dams; Errors; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Outages; Prediction models; Random forests; Reservoirs (water); Statistical tests; Accurate prediction; Dam failure; Emergency response planning; Interpretability; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Model interpretability; Peak outflow; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Search Algorithms; artificial intelligence; dam failure; flood; optimization; outflow; reservoir; Mean square error","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010521519"

For example, classifiers that do not perform data transformations (e.g., cluster-based) perform better when the different classes are separated, typically requiring preprocessed data. Other models (e.g., decision trees) can perform several splits in the feature space, easily obtaining perfect results in training data, but have a higher risk of overfitting with unprocessed data. We use the rbd-GP and M3GP genetic programming algorithms to induce new features based on the original features, to be used by shallow and deep decision tree and random forest models. M3GP is wrapped around a learning algorithm, using its performance as fitness. This way, the induced features are adapted to the classifier, allowing us to compare the complexity of the features induced for the different classifiers. We measure the complexity of the induced features using several structural and functional complexity metrics found in the literature, also proposing a new metric that measures the separability of classes in the feature space. Like other authors, we use complexity as an interpretability metric, selecting three models to discuss and validate based on their performance and size. We apply these methods to remote sensing classification problems and solve two tasks that are hard due to the high similarity between the land cover classes: detecting cocoa agroforest and forecasting forest degradation up to one year in the future. © 2024","Classification; Feature construction; Forest degradation; Genetic programming; Model complexity; Model interpretability; Remote sensing; Time series","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Decision trees; Forest ecology; Random forests; Feature construction; Feature engineerings; Feature space; Forest degradation; Interpretability; Model interpretability; Modeling complexity; Performance; Remote-sensing; Times series; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210540217"

Numerous methods have been investigated to deduce Boolean networks from observed temporal data. However, existing algorithms focus on improving accuracy while neglecting inference explainability. To offer inference explainability without sacrificing accuracy, this paper proposes an explainable multi-objective genetic programming approach to infer large-scale Boolean networks. Unlike existing single-objective algorithms, a new explainable optimization objective is introduced by calculating the average mutual information of the tree nodes. Subsequently, we develop a bio-inspired operation to fully utilize elite solutions and enhance the exploration capability. Additionally, a penalty term for syntax trees is introduced to mitigate overfitting and improve explainability by limiting the tree size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is interpretable and outperforms current leading algorithms in terms of accurately inferring large-scale Boolean networks. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Boolean network; Explainability; Genetic programming; Multi-objective optimization; Mutual information","Biomimetics; Boolean algebra; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Large scale systems; Multiobjective optimization; Trees (mathematics); Boolean Networks; Causal relationships; Discrete complexes; Explainability; Large-scales; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Mutual informations; State transitions; Temporal Data; Genetic programming","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010331205"

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a conceptual methodological approach that integrates a theoretical review to examine the factors influencing academic spin-offs’ decisions to cancel or reduce their presence in international markets, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, and at early or later stages of their internationalization process. Findings: The results suggest that academic spin-offs face more significant challenges in their internationalization process than other small- and medium-sized enterprises. Each of the factors analyzed can explain the type, extent and timing of de-internationalization, and their impact may vary according to the pattern of internationalization followed by these firms. Furthermore, this paper highlights that academic spin-offs de-internationalization processes are often influenced more by internal factors than by external ones. Equally, it is recognized that these factors do not act independently in de-internationalization but are interrelated and may be conditioned by each other. Originality/value: This study offers various perspectives by assessing the nonlinear internationalization patterns of academic spin-offs. Moreover, it contributes significantly to the literature on academic entrepreneurship and internationalization by integrating de-internationalization as an essential component of the international academic spin-off life cycle. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic entrepreneurship; Academic spin-off; Deinternationalization; Internationalization; Nonlinear internationalization","","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003395834"

While CFT can be adaptive, it is also linked to psychological distress, including posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR). Objective: The present study aims to examine the relationship between the frequency and vividness of upward and downward counterfactual thoughts and PTSR, in the recent aftermath of sexual assault (SA). Method: The sample consisted of 327 women who had experienced SA within the last year. PTSR was measured using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), while CFT was assessed through self-reported frequency and vividness of upward (event could have been less severe or avoided) and downward (event could have been worse) counterfactual thoughts. Results: The results revealed a significant difference in the distribution of upward versus downward CFT. Specifically, more participants reported engaging in upward CFT ‘Very Often’ and ‘Often,’ while downward CFT was reported less frequently. Vividness was higher for downward CFT. Both frequency and vividness of upward and downward counterfactuals were significantly associated with higher levels of PTSR. Conclusion: The present findings highlight the role of counterfactual thinking in post-assault distress and emphasize the need for targeted interventions addressing CFT in the aftermath of trauma. © 2025 The Author(s).

The development of Explainable AI (XAI) methods has addressed this limitation by providing human-readable insights into these black-box models, which are widely used in image-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and localization. One popular and effective XAI technique is Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), which uses a large number of random masks to visualize model behavior. However, RISE’s requirement for numerous masks leads to high space complexity.

This study aims to enhance the original DRASTIC model by incorporating three methods to improve its accuracy and reliability in identifying vulnerable groundwater regions (to nitrate) in Zanjan aquifer, Iran. Owing to its remarkable ability, long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) algorithm was implemented to predict groundwater vulnerability based on nitrate contamination and DRASTIC framework. The LSTM model was optimized using the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and equilibrium optimizer (EO) metaheuristic algorithms. The results of the developed models (i.e. LSTM, LSTM-PSO, and LSTM-EO) were compared to those of the original DRASTIC model as a benchmark. Seven parameters of the DRASTIC framework, including depth to groundwater, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity, were used as inputs for the DL models, and the DRASTIC vulnerability index (DVI) derived from the original DRASTIC model, which was adjusted using nitrate samples, was considered as the output. Thereafter, the prioritization of DRASTIC parameters and their effectiveness were evaluated using the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) approach. Additionally, the models explainability was enhanced using the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach. Lastly, all the developed models were evaluated based on the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R²). The MDA results revealed that the soil media and the impact of the vadose zone parameters exerted the highest and lowest impact on the aquifer vulnerability in the study area, respectively, while the summary plot revealed that soil media exerted the highest impact. The vulnerability maps predicted by the DL model and its optimized versions indicated that the central parts of the aquifer exhibited the highest vulnerability, whereas nitrate concentration was low in the north, northwest, south, southeast, and southwest of the Zanjan aquifer. The correlation coefficient (r) between the nitrate concentrations and the LSTM-PSO, LSTM-EO, LSTM, and DRASTIC models was 0.81, 0.78, 0.76, and 0.35, respectively. This indicates the potential of the PSO and EO algorithms to significantly enhance the performance of the optimized LSTM models compared to the standalone LSTM model. Overall, the coupling of the DRASTIC and deep learning models can be a cost-effective tool in groundwater management. © 2025 The Author(s)","Aquifer vulnerability; DRASTIC; Equilibrium optimizer; LSTM; Nitrate; Zanjan aquifer","Associative storage; Benchmarking; Deep learning; Dynamic programming; Forward error correction; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Linear programming; Risk assessment; Time difference of arrival; Aquifer vulnerability; DRASTIC; DRASTIC model; Equilibrium optimizer; Memory modeling; Optimizers; Particle swarm optimizers; Short term memory; Soil medium; Zanjan aquifer; Mean square error","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001228370"

The present study employed machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, enhanced by metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), to address the complexities of predicting shear strength. Comprehensive datasets (1334) incorporating key input parameters related to geometric, material, and mechanical properties were sourced from the literature. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to enhance the interpretability of the models by identifying the global and local importance of features. Moreover, five (5) evaluation matrices, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (RMSE). Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to check the model's performance. The results demonstrate that RF models consistently outperformed LSTM models in predictive accuracy and generalizability. Among the optimized models, RF-WOA-C1 achieved the best performance for Combination 1 (C1), RF-WOA-C2 excelled in Combination 2 (C2), and RF-MFOA-C3 was the top performer for Combination 3 (C3). For Combination 4 (C4), the standalone RF-C4 model delivered exceptional results without requiring additional optimization. SHAP analysis revealed that the projected weld collar (Aw) area, compressive strength of concrete (cm), and stud parameters were the most influential features in predicting shear strength. The research provides significant information regarding the applicability of ML techniques for predicting shear strength. The research can save time and avoid the need for expensive experimental testing. The outcomes enlighten future research and serve as a guide for engineering practice. The findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing RF-based approaches, optimizing critical parameters, and employing SHAP for transparency. © 2025 The Author(s)","Concrete; Machine learning; Prediction; SHAP; Shear strength; Stud connector","Compressive strength; Flame research; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Premixed flames; Random forests; Shear strength; Studs (structural members); Algorithm combinations; Headed stud; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Optimization algorithms; Random forests; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Shears strength; Stud connectors; Studs (fasteners)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218499522"

The success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in deep saline aquifers relies on accurately assessing CO2 solubility in brine under real operating conditions. Gaining detailed insight into CO2 behavior in subsurface environments is essential for effectively implementing this method. In this study, we have made substantial efforts to compile a comprehensive dataset on CO2 solubility in diverse aqueous electrolyte solutions of CaCl2, NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and KCl, encompassing a wide interval of operating conditions and widespread salt concentrations. To leverage this extensive dataset effectively, we applied a robust white-box machine learning technique, namely the multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) to establish user-friendly explicit correlations for accurately predicting CO2 solubility in numerous brines under subsurface conditions. Our evaluation revealed that the derived correlations provided significantly more precise predictions of CO2 solubility. In this context, the MGGP-based correlations demonstrated trustworthy accuracy with total root mean square error (RMSE) values of only 0.0235, 0.0304, 0.0196, 0.0289, and 0.0313 for CaCl2, NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and KCl solutions, respectively. Additionally, the trend analysis showed that the proposed correlations effectively captured the behavior of CO2 solubility across a wide range of operating pressures, temperatures, and solvent salinities, demonstrating their robustness and reliability. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provided useful insights into how different inputs contribute and interact, making the proposed correlations easier to understand and interpret. Lastly, the newly introduced MGGP-based correlations exhibit notable improvements in accuracy, user-friendliness, generalization, and explainability, ensuring superior performance across diverse subsurface conditions. These advancements mark a significant step forward in the cost-effective and precise estimation of CO2 solubility in various brines, making the proposed correlations highly valuable for applications in carbon capture and storage, environmental impact assessment, petroleum geology, reservoir engineering, and other CO2-related domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Brine; Carbon dioxide; Saline aquifers; Sequestration; Solubility","Carbon dioxides (CO); Deep saline aquifers; Effective approaches; Greenhouse gas emissions; Multi-gene genetic programming; Real operating conditions; Saline aquifers; Sequestration; Subsurface conditions; Subsurface environment; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; correlation; prediction; solubility; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002649390"

A stacking regression model combined with a Transformed Target Regressor (TTR) is proposed, utilizing three top-performing base models such as support vector regression (SVR), LightGBM (LGBM), and random forest (RF). The model incorporates 20 key thermodynamic, mismatch, and combination parameters (physical features) along with 18 different elements to enhance generalization and account for various input feature effects, specifically to predict the hardness of HEAs. Feature selection was done in two stages using the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pc) and conditional mutual information-based feature selection (CMIFS) methods. The impact of alloy composition and physical features on hardness was analyzed with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and partial dependence plots (PDPs), helping to better understand the model’s predictions. The stacked model outperformed the individual models, achieving an overall R2 score of 0.88 and 0.99 for composition and physical features-based data, respectively. Additionally, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the hardness of the HEAs, resulting in a more than 24% increase in hardness compared to the initial data. The optimized composition of Al17.24Fe24.79Cr1.95Mo6.84 Ti13.03 Nb7.89 Hf8.26 was identified as having the highest hardness. This ML workflow serves as a general framework to optimize alloy chemical spaces and input features to achieve desired properties.

While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their combined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains underexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to reduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning hyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the difficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster achievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration by substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions offered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios - (1) optimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for material classification - show that the method significantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs. Depending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60% compared to traditional PSO methods. Llama3 achieved a 20% to 40% reduction in model calls for regression tasks, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 reduced model calls by 60% for both regression and classification tasks, all while preserving accuracy and error rates. This groundbreaking methodology offers a very efficient and effective solution for optimizing deep learning models, leading to substantial computational performance improvements across a wide range of applications.  © 2025 IEEE.","Deep learning optimization; hyper-parameter optimization; LLM; machine learning; PSO","Convolutional neural networks; NP-hard; Space research; Deep learning optimization; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Language model; Large language model; Learning models; Learning optimizations; Machine-learning; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Deep learning","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003560950"

Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM’s further enhancement under closed box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches. Furthermore, the text processing and generative capabilities of LLMs would aid in deploying EAs across a wide range of tasks. Based on these complementary advantages, this article provides a thorough review and a forward-looking roadmap, categorizing the reciprocal inspiration into two main avenues: 1) LLM-enhanced EA and 2) EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the complementarity between LLMs and EAs in diverse scenarios, including code generation, software engineering, neural architecture search, and various generation tasks. As the first comprehensive review focused on the EA research in the era of LLMs, this article provides a foundational stepping stone for understanding the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. The identified challenges and future directions offer guidance for researchers and practitioners to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration in propelling advancements in optimization and artificial intelligence. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Algorithm generation; evolutionary algorithm (EA); large language model (LLM); neural architecture search (NAS); optimization problem; prompt engineering","Problem oriented languages; Algorithm generation; Evolutionary algorithm; Language model; Large language model; Natural languages; Neural architecture search; Neural architectures; Optimization problems; Prompt engineering; Roadmap; Software architecture","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003151410"

Conventional robot programming methods often fall short in achieving these complex behaviors. Behavior Trees (BTs) offer a promising alternative due to their modularity, scalability and reactivity. We propose utilizing general purpose, system-prompted Large Language Model (LLM) assistants to decompose task descriptions into executable BTs, which are subsequently refined using Genetic Programming (GP) and a state machine like low-resource BT execution simulator, where they will be tested for task completion. This approach eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby reducing computational costs and saving time and energy.

Histopathological examination of lymphoma tissue images is a diagnostic technique for detecting malignant lymphomas. Differentiating lymphoma subtypes manually is challenging due to their similar morphological features. This paper introduces a cutting-edge methodology for classifying malignant lymphoma using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. It integrates feature reduction using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and model optimization through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in conjunction with DenseNet121 architecture. The DenseNet121 model, which employs four distinct freezing strategies, extracts features from the images, generating an initial 4096 features per image. These features are subsequently reduced by more than 54.4% using PSO, thereby enhancing the computational efficiency without sacrificing classification accuracy. The trained GA Deep Neural Network (DNN) model achieved a significant score of 96.77% testing accuracy with high precision, recall and F1 scores as well. The results after comparison with other existing state-of-the-art models showed the usefulness of the proposed approach in terms of performance as well as the consumption of resources for medical imaging classification. It is recommended that the combined application of PSO for feature reduction and GA for model optimization can be successfully used for improving accuracy rate of such algorithms while reducing computation time. This technique is expected to be further developed and applied in different tasks of computer aided diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in particular the tasks with requirements for explainable artificial intelligence. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligent; deep learning; genetic algorithm; malignant lymphoma; optimized DenseNet121; particle swarm optimization","Deep neural networks; Diagnostic radiography; Artificial intelligent; Deep learning; Features reductions; Learning approach; Malignant lymphomas; Model optimization; Optimized densenet121; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007297582"

Milton Tavares de Souza, Rio de Janeiro, Niterói, 24210-310, Brazil","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban human behaviour is essential for such responses. Crowd-sourced geo-data can be a valuable data source for this understanding. However, previous research often struggles with the complexity and heterogeneity of such data, facing challenges in the utilisation of multiple modalities and explainability. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to identify and rank multimodal time series features derived from mobile phone and geo-social media data based on their association with COVID-19 infection rates in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Our analysis spans from April 6, 2020, to August 31, 2021, and integrates 59 time series features. We introduce a feature selection algorithm based on Chatterjee’s Xi measure of dependence to identify relevant features on an Área Programática da Saúde (health area) and city-wide level. We then compare the predictive power of the selected features against those identified by traditional feature selection methods. Additionally, we contextualise this information by correlating dependence scores and model error with 15 socio-demographic variables such as ethnic distribution and social development. Our results show that social media activity related to COVID-19, tourism and leisure activities was associated most strongly with infection rates, indicated by high dependence scores up to 0.88. Mobility data consistently yielded low to intermediate dependence scores, with the maximum being 0.47. Our feature selection approach resulted in better or equivalent model performance when compared to traditional feature selection methods. At the health-area level, local feature selection generally yielded better model performance compared to city-wide feature selection. Finally, we observed that socio-demographic factors such as the proportion of the Indigenous population or social development correlated with the dependence scores of both mobility data and health- or leisure-related semantic topics on social media. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating localised multimodal features in city-level epidemiological analysis and offer a method for effectively identifying them. In the broader context of GeoAI, our approach provides a framework for identifying and ranking relevant spatiotemporal features, allowing for concrete insights prior to model building, and enabling more transparency when making predictions. © The Author(s) 2025.","Epidemiology; Feature selection; GeoAI; Mobility; Social media; Time series analysis","Feature selection methods; Features selection; GeoAI; Infection rates; Mobility; Modeling performance; Social development; Social media; Time series features; Time-series analysis; Time series","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219621806"

Physics-based models are efficient but fail to capture nonlinear effects, while statistical methods require large datasets that are often impractical to collect in real manufacturing. Improving prediction accuracy under limited data conditions has thus become a critical issue. This study proposes a deep learning system framework that combines genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks (GA-NN). In addition to optimizing the prediction of warping parameters, the proposed GA-NN effectively improves the convergence speed and prediction accuracy. The SHapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is implemented into the neural network to improve the interpretability of the model. The conditional table generative adversarial network (CTGAN) is used for data augmentation and feedback application, combined with the search algorithm to complete the optimal parameter feedback. Experimental validation reveals that the presented methodology attains approximately 97.3% predictive accuracy in semiconductor package warpage estimation tasks, evidently surpassing conventional machine learning models, namely Random Forest (61.9%), SVR (68.7%), and baseline ANN configurations (90.0%). In contrast to prior methods, this study enhances computational throughput, predictive precision, and interpretable visualization correlating package design variables with deformation outcomes. Meanwhile, the proposed approach improves packaging warpage estimation processes, design cycle compression, and manufacturing-level product reliability elevation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Machine learning optimization; Prediction model interpretability; Product parameter feedback; Semiconductor packaging","Electronics packaging; Integrated circuit layout; Labels; Population statistics; Deep learning; Interpretability; Learning optimizations; Machine learning optimization; Machine-learning; Prediction model interpretability; Prediction modelling; Product parameter feedback; Product parameters; Semiconductor packaging; Deep learning","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005597928"

Twenty-two haemodialysis patients selected by snowball sampling from the Indonesian Dialysis Patient Community (Komunitas Pasien Cuci Darah Indonesia) participated. Data were collected through interviews, transcribed and analysed thematically, and psychological methods based on patients' experiences were used. Results: identified three main themes (health coverage system, haemodialysis services, haemodialysis facilities) and ten sub-themes (complex monthly payment situation for care recipients, unexpected deactivation of payment status, outdated referral system requirements, payment system complications for care recipients, penalty for late payments, disparities in services between hospitals, insufficient coverage for certain services, accessibility problems with distant haemodialysis units, variations in types of haemodialysis equipment, and inadequate comfort in the family waiting room). Conclusions: The health insurance system needs to be improved to increase access, equity, affordability, efficiency, consistency and quality of haemodialysis services in Indonesian hospitals.

This stems from their inherently stochastic, population-driven searches, which complicate the use of standard explainability techniques. In this article, we present a method to identify which decision variables have the greatest impact during an algorithm's trajectory from random initialsation to convergence. We apply Principal Component Analysis to project each population onto a lower-dimensional space, then introduce two metrics - Mean Variable Contribution and Proportion of Aligned Variables - to identify the variables most responsible for guiding the search. Using four different population-based methods (Particle Swarm Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) on 24 BBOB benchmark functions in 10 dimensions, we find that these metrics highlight meaningful variable relationships and provide a window into each method's search dynamics. By comparing the features extracted across algorithms and problems, we illustrate how certain variable subsets consistently drive major improvements in solution quality. In doing so, new evolutionary algorithm variants can be designed to take advantage of these influential variables, while also identifying underutilised variables that may benefit alternative search strategies.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Algorithm Trajectories; Evolutionary Algorithms; Population Diversity; Principal Component Analysis; Visualisation","Genetic algorithms; AI systems; Algorithm trajectory; Decision variables; Feature mining; Low-dimensional spaces; Metaheuristic; Population diversity; Principal Components; Principal-component analysis; Stochastic population; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007020512"

However, the subsequent risk of clinical events in patients with coronary artery disease is not determined solely by lesion characteristics or how these lesions are treated. The current study investigated whether the effects of intravascular imaging in complex PCI vary according to atherothrombotic risks. Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of the RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI trial, which compared intravascular imaging-guided PCI with angiography-guided PCI in patients with complex coronary artery lesions. The study population was stratified by atherothrombotic risk, assessed using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score for secondary prevention (TRS-2P). TRS-2P is calculated based on the presence of the following factors: age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Patients were categorized into low-risk (TRS-2P < 3) or high-risk (TRS-2P ≥ 3) groups. The primary endpoint was target vessel failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Results: Among the total study population, 1247 patients were categorized as low-risk, and 392 as high-risk. The risk of target vessel failure was significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (15.5% vs 7.2%; HR, 2.13; 95%CI, 1.51-3.00; P < .001). The benefits of intravascular imaging-guided PCI over angiography-guided PCI did not differ between the low-risk group (5.6% vs 10.4%; HR, 0.56; 95%CI, 0.36-0.86) and the high-risk group (14.1% vs 18.5%; HR, 0.71; 95%CI, 0.41-1.24), with no significant interaction (interaction P = .496). Conclusions: In this hypothesis-generating post hoc analysis of the RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI trial, patients with high atherothrombotic risk had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with low atherothrombotic risk. Nevertheless, the prognostic impact of intravascular imaging-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI was similarly observed in both low- and high-risk groups.

Genetic Programming (GP) is one of the most interpretable machine learning algorithms currently available. While certain datasets necessitate complex GP models to capture underlying patterns, others may not require such complexity. However, GP lacks a mechanism to dynamically assess the required model complexity during evolution. As a result, GP often evolves overly complex models that are challenging to analyze, thereby reducing interpretability. This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed to evolve compact multi-objective GP models without significantly compromising regression error, thereby enhancing interpretability. The proposed method employs NSGA-II to simultaneously minimize regression error and maximize a newly introduced per-node importance metric. This metric quantifies the contribution of each node in terms of error reduction. By leveraging this metric, the algorithm discards large GP models containing many low-importance nodes, effectively avoiding unnecessarily complex solutions. Experimental results on ten regression datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently evolves smaller GP models with better interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance, particularly on high-dimensional datasets.  © 2025 IEEE.","Genetic Programming; Interpretability; NSGA-II; Per-node Importance; Regression","Artificial intelligence; Errors; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Genetic programming modeling; Interpretability; Multi objective; Node importance; NSGA-II; Per-node importance; Real-world; Regression; Regression errors; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010409296"

Although LLMs have demonstrated success in program synthesis, there remains a lack of trust in the generated code due to documented risks (e.g., code with known and risky vulnerabilities). Therefore, it is important to restrict the search space and avoid bad programs. In this work, pre-defined restricted Backus–Naur Form (BNF) grammars are utilised, which are considered ‘safe’, and the focus is on identifying the most effective technique for grammar-obeying program synthesis, where the generated code must be correct and conform to the predefined grammar. It is shown that while LLMs perform well in generating correct programs, they often fail to produce code that adheres to the grammar. To address this, a novel Similarity-Based Many-Objective Grammar Guided Genetic Programming (SBMaOG3P) approach is proposed, leveraging the programs generated by LLMs in two ways: (i) as seeds following a grammar mapping process and (ii) as targets for similarity measure objectives. Experiments on a well-known and widely used program synthesis dataset indicate that the proposed approach successfully improves the rate of grammar-obeying program synthesis compared to various LLMs and the state-of-the-art Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming. Additionally, the proposed approach significantly improved the solution in terms of the best fitness value of each run for 21 out of 28 problems compared to G3P. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Grammar; Grammar guided GP; LLMs; Multi-objective; Program synthesis","Context free grammars; Context sensitive grammars; Grammar; Grammar guided genetic programming; Grammar guided GP; Language model; Large language model; Multi objective; Program synthesis; Research interests; Search spaces; Two ways; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208936966"

This research introduces the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Explainer (MOGAE), a novel model-agnostic local explainer for image data aimed at the early detection of citrus diseases. MOGAE enhances eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) by leveraging the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with an adaptive Bit Flip Mutation (BFM) incorporating densify and sparsify operators to adjust superpixel granularity automatically. This innovative approach simplifies the explanation process by eliminating several critical hyperparameters required by traditional methods like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). To develop the citrus disease classification model, we preprocess the leaf dataset through stratified data splitting, oversampling, and augmentation techniques, then fine-tuning a pre-trained Residual Network 50 layers (ResNet50) model. MOGAE's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparative analyses with the Ensemble-based Genetic Algorithm Explainer (EGAE) and LIME, showing superior accuracy and interpretability using criteria such as numeric accuracy of explanation and Number of Function Evaluations (NFE). We assess accuracy both intuitively and numerically by measuring the Euclidean distance between expert-provided explanations and those generated by the explainer. The appendix also includes an extensive evaluation of MOGAE on the melanoma dataset, highlighting its versatility and robustness in other domains.

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a PSO-XGBoost fraud detection framework and uses explainable artificial intelligence to interpret the predictions. The framework combines an XGBoost classifier with the particle swarm optimization algorithm and is validated through a comparative evaluation against other models. Traditional methods, including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and BP Neural Network, demonstrate moderate accuracy, ranging from 54.1% to 68.6%, while more advanced models like Random Forest reach up to 78.4%. Compared to the standard XGBoost, the PSO-optimized model achieves 3% superior accuracy, achieving an impressive 95% success rate. Moreover, SHAP is used to extract and visually depict the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. It turns out that the policyholder's claim amount is the most significant factor in detecting automobile insurance fraud, with other factors such as vehicle type, responsible party, and the insurer's age also considerably influencing the prediction performance. This paper therefore proves that combining the PSO-XGBoost model with SHAP approach can substantially improve the early warning and prevention of automobile insurance fraud. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Automobile insurance; Fraud detection; PSO-XGBoost; SHAP","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209255636"

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between PROs and dosimetry in OPSCC patients on two elective neck irradiation (ENI) de-escalation trials. Methods: Eligible patients in this analysis had a diagnosis of OPSCC and were treated on two ENI de-escalation trials. Contoured OARs included oral cavity (OC), floor of mouth (FoM), superior/middle constrictors (SMC), parotid glands (PG), submandibular glands (SMG), and tubarial glands (TG). OAR metrics were dichotomized at the median and in tertiles. The primary endpoints were 3- and 12-month PROs: the overall MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) and Dry Mouth (DM) and Sticky Saliva (SS) scores from the EORTC HN35. Results: The analysis includes 86 patients. The median mean doses were contralateral (CL, 15.7 Gy) and ipsilateral PG (26.3 Gy), contralateral SMG (35.3 Gy), OC (29.3 Gy), and SMC (47 Gy). OC, SMC and TG were significant predictors of 12-month MDADI, with a dose–response below the lowest tertile.

Oral cavity, FOM, and SMG doses were associated with 12 month SS outcomes. Conclusions: In a cohort of patients treated with de-escalated IMRT, the critical impact of OC and SMG doses became evident.

However, the efficacy and consistency of LLMs still rely on the structure and quality of prompts (i.e., their input instructions). In real-world applications, the need for specialized prompt engineering, qualified staff, and domain knowledge often results in suboptimal performance and increased development costs. This paper explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in generating and optimizing prompts for LLMs, with the aim of enhancing their performance across various tasks tackled by diversely skilled teams. Here, we customize a standard GA implementation to work with textual individuals, which are initialized and manipulated by LLM-defined crossover and mutation operators to evolve candidate prompts. This approach enables the automated discovery of LLM-based solutions across a broad range of problems with minimal human effort. This process allows LLMs to achieve optimized outputs that are comparable to or even superior to those obtained through expert, costly labor. We test our approach on four modern LLMs by OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral, and four domain-specific problems. Our results demonstrate quantitative improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to human prompt engineers. Achieving an average accuracy 24% higher than that of manual crafted prompts, our results also prove the viability and potential of autonomous optimization tools to discover high-performing prompt configurations, reducing the need for extensive human intervention and trial-and-error methods.  © 2025 IEEE.","automated prompt engineering; Genetic Algorithms; LLM prompt optimization","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cost engineering; Genetic engineering; Automated prompt engineering; Development costs; Domain knowledge; Language model; Large language model prompt optimization; Optimisations; Performance; Real-world; Standard genetic algorithm; Sub-optimal performance; Genetic algorithms","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010436801"

At its core, the attention mechanism remains an indispensable component of advanced Transformer architectures, with its significance and contributions widely acknowledged by the AI community. However, as research deepens and the demand for solving more complex real-world tasks increases, researchers have gradually identified bottlenecks in the self-attention mechanism, with some hypotheses validated through experimental observations. Despite these advances, current studies on the limitations of the self-attention mechanism are primarily centered on empirical observations and experimental results, lacking rigorous theoretical foundations. This gap has led to limited interpretability and unclear rationales behind some findings, despite their potential significance. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of the attention mechanism in Transformer models and provide an in-depth analysis of its capability bottleneck within the data-driven research paradigm. We identify a distinct capability boundary of the traditional attention mechanism and present a comprehensive theoretical analysis based on causal sampling theory. To validate our theoretical findings, we evaluate them in the context of the challenging task of Video Situation Recognition (VSR), obtaining experimental results that align with our theoretical conclusions. We hope that the findings of this study will inspire new perspectives on the capabilities of attention mechanisms and contribute positively to the development of optimization strategies in attention mechanism design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanism; Causal inference; Event extraction; Video content parsing","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Video recording; 'current; Attention mechanisms; Causal inferences; De-biasing; Events extractions; Performance; Real-world task; Transformer modeling; Video content parsing; Video contents; Article; artificial intelligence; causality; community; decision making; deep neural network; enzyme mechanism; generalization (psychology); human; hypothesis; knowledge; language model; process optimization; quantitative analysis; videorecording; Machine design","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009477627"

It is almost impossible to explain the large-scale RNN directly. A feasible method is to generalize the rules undermining it, that is, model abstraction. To deal with the low efficiency and excessive information loss in existing model abstraction for RNNs, this work proposes a PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-based model abstraction and explanation generation method for RNNs. Firstly, the k-means clustering is applied to preliminarily partition the RNN decision process state. Secondly, a frequency prefix tree is constructed based on the traces, and a PSO algorithm is designed to implement state merging to address the problem of vast state space. Then, a PFA (probabilistic finite automata) is constructed to explain the RNN structure with preserving the origin RNN information as much as possible. Finally, the quantitative keywords are labeled as an explanation for classification results, which are automatically generated with the abstract model PFA. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in some cases. © 2024 by the authors.","explanation; model abstraction; Particle Swarm Optimization; probabilistic finite automata; recurrent neural network","Abstracting; Classification (of information); Finite automata; K-means clustering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Text processing; Trees (mathematics); A-particles; Classifier models; Explanation; Model abstraction; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic finite automata; State-space; Swarm optimization; Text classifiers; Recurrent neural networks","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194220668"

However, the unclear query statements of the detectors pose a challenge to the intelligent question answering task. Existing knowledge graph-based question-answering systems face issues of vocabulary limitations and reliance on fixed templates. Solely relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) for questioning introduces noise and randomness due to their extensive knowledge base. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach that synergistically employs both knowledge graphs and LLMs for intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection. The method divides the overall task into five units, progressively clarifying query statements for accurate answers. Leveraging LLM’s vast prior knowledge, robust semantic understanding, and contextual learning mitigates issues related to vocabulary limitations and template dependence. Simultaneously, the knowledge contained in the graph is integrated into an optimal clarification path and transferred to LLM to address noise and randomness, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the clarification process. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision, and Recall metrics all above 0.73. The results affirm the method’s effectiveness in improving the accuracy of intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection, with potential implications for similar applications in other domains of hydraulic engineering. © 2024 The Author(s).

The model incorporates a Gated Multi-scale Coordinate Attention (GM-CA) module to filter out noise and irrelevant information in the image, while capturing location information of diseases and pests at different scales. The model also utilizes an improved feature extraction module called Asymmetrical Ghost (AG) module to enhance robustness to image flipping, as well as improve feature extraction capabil-ities.

Commonly, MR under different conditions of confining pressures and deviatoric stresses are tested by cyclic triaxial compressive experiments. However, such experiments are elaborate, expensive, and time-consuming, so developing more flexible and efficient approaches is imperative. This study investigates the potential application of a tree-based model termed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) on predicting MR. First, a dataset containing 891 samples of repeated load triaxial tests and the characteristics of subgrade soil is collected. Then, an XGBoost model, combined with a feature selection technique (Exhaustive Feature Selector (EFS)) and an optimization algorithm (Jellyfish Swarm Optimizer (JSO)), is trained on the collected dataset. EFS is used to identify the most suitable combinations of factors for MR prediction and JSO is applied to determine the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model, which aim to establish a robust XGBoost model with the best predictive capacity. Lastly, this study employs two advanced model interpretation techniques to identify the predominant factors affecting MR prediction based on the established XGBoost model. The results indicated that the EFS approach can effectively ascertain the best combination of factors for MR prediction; the JSO algorithm can effectively capture the optimal hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model; the resultant XGBoost model achieved a favorable capacity for MR prediction. Moreover, three primary factors affecting MR prediction are unveiled, which are the degree of soil saturation (Sr), confining stress (σ3), and plasticity index (PI). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Exhaustive feature selector; Extreme gradient boosting; Jellyfish swarm optimizer; Resilient modulus","algorithm; compression; confining pressure; flexure; heuristics; meta-analysis; optimization; pavement; plasticity; prediction; pressure effect; stress field; structural analysis; structural response; triaxial test","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186195720"

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EVOPROMPT, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EVOPROMPT starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EVOPROMPT significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EVOPROMPT demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.

However, the surrogate of these SAEAs is underutilized to a large extent, which limits the search efficiency of these algorithms. To be specific, existing algorithms do not sufficiently exploit the estimated solution quality information from the surrogate models during offspring generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an SAEA framework named EXO-SAEA (EXplanation Operator based Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm). First, it divides the current population into two populations according to the a priori knowledge from the surrogate model. Then, for each solution in the first population, EXO-SAEA employs the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to estimate the contribution of each decision variable to the fitness values. After that, the Shapley values are then normalized for the offspring generation of the first population, while the second population uses generic GA operators. Two representative surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are used to instantiate the proposed framework. Experimental results on the synthetic benchmark problems and three real-world problems involving six state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Crossover operator; Expensive optimization; Explainable machine learning; Multi-objective optimization; Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm","Evolutionary algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Crossover operator; Expensive optimization; Explainable machine learning; Machine-learning; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Search efficiency; Surrogate modeling; Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm; Multiobjective optimization","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194762260"

Regional Flood frequency Analysis (RFFA) is one of the most commonly used approaches to estimate design floods in ungauged watersheds. This study used XGBoost coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to estimate different quantiles of the design floods with return periods (from 2-year to 1000-year). After a preliminary assessment, 373 nationwide hydrometric stations were selected to conduct at-site flood frequency analysis by identifying the best-fitting distribution. Using the capabilities of GIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE), 83 independent features including different physiographical, geomorphological, land-use, soil types, and long-term hydro-climatic and environmental variables were extracted for the upstream watersheds. After fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost method for each flood quantile, the feature importance values were used to eliminate the insignificant features and refine the developed models. Additionally, classical methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) were implemented, to evaluate the XGBoost models efficiency. Different statistics demonstrated that the models effectively estimated flood quantiles, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) varying from 0.709 to 0.840 across all models. A comparison of model performance reveals that the XGBoost method outperformed RF and SVR across all flood quantiles. Based on the developed models, design floods have been estimated for 949 stations across Iran. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were used to identify the main contributing features to model outputs and investigate the spatial heterogeneity of main flood drivers. According to the results, the perimeter and length of the watershed and heavy rainfall exhibit notably high importance compared to other features for all models. Based on the local SHAP values, in Northern, Northwestern, and Western basins, features associated with watershed sizes, such as perimeter, area and length exhibit the highest levels of importance. Moreover, the Southwest basins are more influenced by “heavy rainfall”. These findings demonstrate the promise of the developed models for estimating flood quantiles across diverse environmental, geomorphological, and hydro-climatic conditions. This capability is valuable for sustainable watershed management, especially in environments with limited maximum discharge data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Flood drivers; Google Earth Engine; Regional flood frequency analysis; SHAP; Spatial heterogeneity; XGBoost","Iran; Efficiency; Engines; Forestry; Land use; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Design flood; Flood driver; Flood quantiles; Google earth engine; Google earths; Regional flood frequency analysis; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Spatial heterogeneity; Xgboost; exploration; flood frequency; frequency analysis; GIS; heterogeneity; hydrological modeling; peak discharge; rainfall; watershed; Floods","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196004354"

Our analysis reveals that while the pipelines we developed did not surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) models regarding raw performance, they offer a significantly reduced carbon footprint. We discovered SML optimal pipelines with competitive performance and up to 70 times less carbon emissions than hybrid or fully LLM pipelines, such as standard BERT and DistilBERT variants. Similarly, we obtain hybrid pipelines (using SML and LLMs) with between 20% and 50% reduced carbon emissions compared to fine-tuned alternatives and only a marginal decrease in performance.

Instead, the evaluation of the knowledge that these models have of the languages has received much less attention. For example, the words that they can recognize and use in different languages. In this paper, we evaluate the knowledge that open chat LLMs have of Spanish words by testing a sample of words in a reference dictionary.

While there are already some sample reweighting methods based on Marginal Structural Model for eliminating the confounding bias, they generally focus on removing the treatment’s linear dependence on confounders and rely on the accuracy of the assumed parametric models, which are usually unverifiable. In this paper, we propose a de-confounding representation learning (DRL) framework for counterfactual outcome estimation of continuous treatment by generating the representations of covariates decorrelated with the treatment variables. The DRL is a non-parametric model that eliminates both linear and nonlinear dependence between treatment and covariates. Specifically, we train the correlations between the de-confounding representations and the treatment variables against the correlations between the covariate representations and the treatment variables to eliminate confounding bias. Further, a counterfactual inference network is embedded into the framework to make the learned representations serve both de-confounding and trusted inference. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that the DRL model performs superiorly in learning de-confounding representations and outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual inference models for continuous treatment variables. In addition, we apply the DRL model to a real-world medical dataset MIMIC III and demonstrate a detailed causal relationship between red cell width distribution and mortality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Adversarial Network; Continuous Treatment; Counterfactual Inference; De-confounding Representation","Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Causal inferences; Continuous treatments; Counterfactual inference; Counterfactuals; Covariates; De-confounding representation; Learning models; Linear dependence; Real-world; Generative adversarial networks","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198053709"

Therefore, determining the best care for a patient is hard. Currently, if no significant tumor growth is observed, treatment is often delayed, as treatment itself is not without risk. However, by doing so, the risk of (irreversible) adverse effects due to tumor growth may increase. Being able to predict the growth accurately could assist in determining whether a patient will need treatment during their lifetime and, if so, the timing of this treatment. The aim of this work is to learn the general underlying growth pattern of paragangliomas from multiple tumor growth data sets, in which each data set contains a tumor's volume over time. To do so, we propose a novel approach based on genetic programming to learn a function class, i.e., a parameterized function that can be fit anew for each tumor. We do so in a unique, multi-modal, multi-objective fashion to find multiple potentially interesting function classes in a single run. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic and a real-world data set. By analyzing the resulting function classes, we can effectively explain the general patterns in the data. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

High Energy Phys. JHEP05(2023)015), we showed that the strictly massless spin-3/2 field, as well as the strictly and partially massless spin-5/2 fields, on N-dimensional ( N ⩾ 3 ) de Sitter (dS) spacetime (dS N ) are non-unitary unless N = 4. The (non-)unitarity was demonstrated by simply observing that there is a (mis-)match between the representation-theoretic labels that correspond to the unitary irreducible representations (UIR’s) of the dS algebra spin ( N , 1 ) and the ones corresponding to the space of eigenmodes of the field theories. In this paper, we provide a technical representation-theoretic explanation for this fact by studying the (non-)existence of positive-definite, dS invariant scalar products for the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 strictly/partially massless eigenmodes on dS N  ( N ⩾ 3 ). Our basic tool is the examination of the action of spin ( N , 1 ) generators on the space of eigenmodes, leading to the following findings. For odd N, any dS invariant scalar product is identically zero. For even N > 4, any dS invariant scalar product must be indefinite. This gives rise to positive-norm and negative-norm eigenmodes that mix with each other under spin ( N , 1 ) boosts. In the N = 4 case, the positive-norm sector decouples from the negative-norm sector and each sector separately forms a UIR of spin(4, 1).

A multi-modal screening approach, incorporating Star-Transformer and Vision Transformer, enables accurate prediction of antiviral activity and toxicity, leading to the identification of potent and safe candidates. SHAP analysis further enhances interpretability by explaining the underlying mechanisms of peptide activity. Our in vitro experiments confirmed the antiviral efficacy of peptides generated by AVP-GPT2, with some exhibiting EC50 values as low as 0.01 μM and CC50 values > 30 μM. This represents a substantial improvement over AVP-GPT and traditional methods. AVP-GPT2 has the potential to significantly impact antiviral drug discovery by accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic agents. Future research will explore its application to other viral targets and its integration into existing drug development pipelines. © 2024 by the authors.","antiviral activity screening model; antiviral peptide; generation model; SHAP; star-transformer; toxicity screening model; vision-transformer","Antiviral Agents; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Peptides; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; antiviral peptide; peptide; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; peptide; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; analysis; antiviral activity; Article; AVP GPT2 platform; cell viability assay; Coronaviridae; cytotoxicity; evaluation study; frequency analysis; Hepatitis C virus; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human respiratory syncytial virus; in vitro study; Influenza virus; information processing; nonhuman; physicochemical model; random forest; screening; software; structure analysis; support vector machine; toxicity; ultra performance liquid chromatography; chemistry; drug development; drug effect; drug therapy; human; preclinical study; procedures; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virology","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216077868"

Genetic programming (GP) has been used to obtain interpretable ML models because it operates at the level of functional building blocks: if these building blocks are interpretable, there is a chance that their composition (i.e., the entire ML model) is also interpretable. However, the degree to which a model is interpretable depends on the observer. Motivated by this, we study a recently-introduced human-in-The-loop system that allows the user to steer GP's generation process to their preferences, which shall be online-learned by an artificial neural network (ANN). We focus on the generation of ML models as analytical functions (i.e., symbolic regression) as this is a key problem in interpretable ML, and propose a two-fold contribution. First, we devise more general representations for the ML models for the ANN to learn upon, to enable the application of the system to a wider range of problems. Second, we delve into a deeper analysis of the system's components. To this end, we propose an incremental experimental evaluation, aimed at (1) studying the effectiveness by which an ANN can capture the perceived interpretability for simulated users, (2) investigating how the GP's outcome is affected across different simulated user feedback profiles, and (3) determining whether humans participants would prefer models that were generated with or without their involvement. Our results pose clarity on pros and cons of using a human-in-The-loop approach to discover interpretable ML models with GP. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, lack of interpretability, and ethical concerns persist. This study addresses these gaps by developing an interpretable AI model to predict snack choices in a controlled laboratory experiment. Method: a random forest classifier was trained to predict participants’ snack choices (healthy vs. unhealthy) based on contextual factors (hunger, mood, time of day) and historical choices. Data were collected from 75 adults over 10 sessions, with features engineered to capture both immediate and longitudinal patterns. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance analysis. Results: the model achieved 85,33 % accuracy, with hunger level, historical choices, and mood identified as the most influential predictors. Performance improved over sessions (peaking at 93,33 % accuracy in sessions 8–9), highlighting the value of longitudinal data. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across age, gender, and BMI, with higher accuracy for participants with healthier habits and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: this study demonstrates the feasibility of interpretable AI models in predicting dietary behavior while addressing ethical concerns through rigorous data anonymization and informed consent protocols. The findings underscore the potential of AI to inform personalized interventions for healthier eating habits and provide a framework for ethical AI implementation in behavioral research. © 2025; Los autores.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Behavioral Prediction; Ethical AI; Interpretability; Random Forest Classifier; Snack Choice","","","AG Editor (Uruguay)","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006826981"

However, these methods can be slow for time-critical applications due to the iterative stochastic processes they perform. This problem becomes even more pronounced in dynamic environments such as cloud systems. This paper proposes an interpretable rule-based solution to minimize this problem. Combining metaheuristic task scheduling solutions and machine learning techniques, this method uses a two-phase mechanism, semi-offline and online. In the semi-offline phase, we first archive metaheuristic solutions to previously randomly generated or encountered task-scheduling problems. The basic idea of the proposed method is to reuse these previously obtained successful metaheuristic solution patterns for future similar problems. Finding similar solution patterns from this extensive archive dataset is done by automatically extracting rule sets through machine learning techniques. These interpretable rule sets are used to identify the type of task scheduling problem encountered in the online phase and to find the optimal solution pattern. The performance of this method, which dramatically reduces execution time and enables the use of metaheuristics in time-critical applications, has been tested and proven for various cloud task-scheduling scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Metaheuristic; Rule-based algorithm; Task scheduling","Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multitasking; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic systems; Cloud systems; Cloud-computing; Interpretable rules; Machine learning techniques; Metaheuristic; Rule based; Rule based algorithms; Solution patterns; Tasks scheduling; Time-critical applications; Random processes","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180999062"

To effectively monitor and combat this problem, accurate predictive models are essential. This research focused on employing machine learning (ML) techniques to construct some models for analyzing the adsorption capacity of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic from contaminated water. The robustness of ten machine learning algorithms was evaluated using performance metrics such as the Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Square Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The hyperparameters of the ML models were fine-tuned using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The optimized models were comprehensively evaluated using feature importance analysis to quantify the relative significance of operational variables accurately. After a thorough assessment and comparison of various machine learning models, it was evident that the HistGradientBoosting (HGB) model outperformed others in terms of CIP adsorption performance. This was supported by their low MAE value of 0.1865 and high R2 value of 0.9999. The modeling projected the highest antibiotic adsorption (99.28%) under optimized conditions, including 10 mg/L of CIP, 357 mg/L of CuWO4@TiO2 adsorbent, a contact time of 60 min at room temperature, and near neutral pH (7.5). The combination of advanced ML algorithms and nano adsorbents has great potential for addressing the problem of antibiotic pollution in water sources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian optimization; Ciprofloxacin adsorption; Gradient Boosting; Machine learning; Nano adsorbent","Adsorption; Algorithms; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bayes Theorem; Ciprofloxacin; Machine Learning; Water Pollutants, Chemical; adsorbent; ciprofloxacin; water; antiinfective agent; Bayesian optimization; Ciprofloxacin adsorption; Gradient boosting; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mean absolute error; Metaheuristic; Nano adsorbents; Water source; adsorption; algorithm; antibiotics; Bayesian analysis; machine learning; nanotechnology; optimization; adsorption; Article; Bayes theorem; comparative study; contact time; correlation coefficient; decision tree; descriptive research; explainable machine learning; mean absolute error; mean squared error; metaheuristics; prediction; random forest; root mean squared error; waste water management; water contamination; water supply; adsorption; algorithm; chemistry; machine learning; water pollutant; Contrastive Learning","","Academic Press","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205718817"

Objective: The aim of this research work is to addresses the issue of noise reduction and to predict Alzheimer's disease detection efficiently. Methods: First, we present a genetic programming (GP) technique for reducing Rician noise in MRI images to pre-process the dataset. To effectively reduce Rician noise, this GP approach combines a Feature Extraction component, GP Optimal Expression, and an Optimum Removal Estimation component. In the second phase, we design and develop an explainable Deep Learning framework. This framework uses a local data-driven interpretation technique based on SHAP values to investigate the relationship between the neural network's estimated AD diagnosis and the input MRI images. In addition, we handle class distribution by combining an oversampling strategy with a minority approach. Several assessment metrics are used to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Results: The proposed method is tested on a variety of medical samples, and the results are compared to those obtained using other comparable approaches. We also test and compare our model to three cutting-edge models: DenseNet169, VGGNet15, and Inceptionv3. Conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed model outperforms others, particularly in handling basic structures with limited spectral features, lower computational complexity, and less overfitting.

However, recently researchers have demonstrated that previous approaches are severely limited in out-of-distribution generalization, thus proposing the De-biased TSG challenge which requires models to overcome weakness towards outlier test samples. In this paper, we design a novel framework, termed Counterfactually-Augmented Event Matching (CAEM), which incorporates counterfactual data augmentation to learn event-query joint representations to resist the training bias. Specifically, it consists of three components: (1) A Temporal Counterfactual Augmentation module that generates counterfactual video-text pairs by temporally delaying events in the untrimmed video, enhancing the model's capacity for counterfactual thinking. (2) An Event-Query Matching model that is used to learn joint representations and predict corresponding matching scores for each event candidate. (3) A Counterfact-Adaptive Framework (CAF) that incorporates the counterfactual consistency rules on the matching process of the same event-query pairs, furtherly mitigating the bias learned from training sets. We conduct thorough experiments on two widely used DTSG datasets, i.e., Charades-CD and ActivityNet-CD, to evaluate our proposed CAEM method. Extensive experimental results show our proposed CAEM method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.

However, due to geographical and socio-economic constraints in these regions, flood-related sample data are generally scarce. This study introduces a Mean Filter (MF) grounded in the point-area duality perspective, combined with a feature selection approach utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms. Three such algorithms (NSGA-II, SPEA2, and NSPSO) were applied to generate the Pareto front of flood susceptibility features, followed by a comprehensive evaluation using the CRITIC-TOPSIS method. The results show that NSGA-II performed best in terms of Hypervolume, Spacing, Generational Distance, and the number of Pareto solutions. The selected feature subsets demonstrated improvements across multiple model validations, with the GB model achieving the highest overall performance and stability. Notably, half of the retained features are related to buffer zone and watershed characteristics, and the SHAP analysis indicates that the mean Topographic Wetness Index within the 50-m buffer zone is the main contributor to flood risk. This finding validates the effectiveness of the MF strategy based on the point-area duality perspective under limited sample conditions, offering a new approach for flood studies with sparse data in mountainous regions. © 2024","Feature selection; Flood risk; Machine learning; Mountainous settlements; SHapley Additive exPlanations","Algorithms; Climate Change; Floods; Models, Theoretical; Pareto principle; Risk assessment; Buffer zones; Features selection; Flood risks; Global climate changes; Machine-learning; Mean filter; Mountainous settlement; NSGA-II; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; buffer zone; climate change; flood control; machine learning; optimization; watershed; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; Bayesian learning; climate change; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; disaster; feature selection; flooding; genetic algorithm; global climate; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; mountain; multilayer perceptron; multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; multiobjective optimization; particle swarm optimization; performance indicator; precipitation; random forest; risk; risk assessment; risk management; Shapley additive explanation; soil moisture; support vector machine; surface property; surface runoff; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; topography; watershed; algorithm; climate change; theoretical model; Multiobjective optimization","","Academic Press","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214214263"

The methodology involves genetic algorithm for feature selection, followed by extreme gradient boosting analysis. The eight parametric genetic algorithm - extreme gradient boosting analysis has high statistical acceptance with R2tr = 0.895, R2L10%O = 0.900, and Q2F3 = 0.873. Shapley additive explanations, which provide each variable in a model an importance value, served as the foundation for the interpretation. Then, ceteris paribus approach involving comparison of counterfactual examples has been used to understand the influence of a structural feature on activity profile. The analysis indicates that aromatic carbon, ring/non-ring nitrogen in combination with other structural features govern the inhibitory profile.

In the study reported here, we aimed to determine the overall 52-week cumulative clinical benefit of treatment initiated with deucravacitinib versus apremilast and to compare the 52-week cumulative benefit of initiating and staying on deucravacitinib versus initiating apremilast and continuing or switching to deucravacitinib at week 24 of treatment. Methods: This post hoc analysis of POETYK PSO-1 data (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03624127) determined the cumulative clinical benefit of deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily and apremilast 30 mg twice daily in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with apremilast who did not achieve a 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 24 were switched to deucravacitinib. The cumulative clinical benefit of deucravacitinib versus apremilast over 52 weeks was based on cumulative measures of ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in PASI score (PASI 75) and the proportion of patients with a static Physician Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (sPGA 0/1). Ratios of area under the curve estimates between treatments were calculated and compared based on analysis of covariance regression models. Results: Patients initiating deucravacitinib (N = 332) had a greater cumulative benefit as measured by the PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 than those initiating apremilast (N = 168). Over 52 weeks, those initiating deucravacitinib experienced 50% more benefit as measured by PASI 75 and 58% more benefit as measured by sPGA 0/1 than those initiating apremilast. Results were consistent with the primary analysis when patients were classified by prior systemic and prior biologic therapy exposure. Conclusion: Results from this analysis corroborate the primary efficacy analysis supporting the use of deucravacitinib compared with apremilast for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, regardless of prior systemic or biologic use. © The Author(s) 2024.","Apremilast, cumulative clinical benefit; Deucravacitinib; Oral treatments; Psoriasis; Small molecules","apremilast; deucravacitinib; adult; area under the curve; Article; biological therapy; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient coding; post hoc analysis; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; static physician global assessment score; study design; systemic therapy; treatment outcome","","Adis","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196648423"

Despite numerous successful applications, several studies have shown that the NSGA-II is less effective for larger numbers of objectives. In this work, we use mathematical runtime analyses to rigorously demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon. We show that even on the simple m-objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in sub-exponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently. This is not a problem for two objectives, where any sorting of a pair-wise incomparable set of solutions according to one objective is also such a sorting according to the other objective (in the inverse order).This paper for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2024 summarizes the work Weijie Zheng, Benjamin Doerr: Runtime Analysis for the NSGA-II: Proving, Quantifying, and Explaining the Inefficiency For Many Objectives.

However, finding the information users need from this vast data has become challenging. To tackle this problem, recommending preferred information to users is becoming increasingly important. However, accurately recommending information by analyzing existing models such as GraphRec is still a challenging problem. A method called PSO_KFCM is proposed in this paper to solve this problem better. The technique combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with hybrid optimization and the kernel fuzzy C-means clustering technique to cluster similar recommendation data into one class. This way, the complexity and randomness of the recommendation data are reduced. It improves the speed and accuracy of the model prediction, which lays a solid foundation for the subsequent recommendation. Various factors will impact the recommendation process, and channel and spatial characteristics are essential. CBAM attention is added to the original attention mechanism to fully utilize these features in the recommendation data to enhance its performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a social recommendation prediction method that combines CBAM attention and PSO_KFCM clustering and introduces a new social model called TTYGNN. The TTYGNN model optimizes the recommendation effect while maintaining the original advantages, enabling users to obtain the required information more quickly and accurately. To verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model, extensive experimental comparisons were conducted on two widely used datasets. The results show that the TTYGNN model outperforms similar methods in all indicators, proving its superiority in information recommendation. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

The combination of LS and GP aims to produce an interpretable control law as similar as possible to the optimal control scheme reference. Inclusive Genetic Programming (IGP), a GP heuristic capable of promoting and maintaining the population diversity, is chosen as the GP algorithm since it proved successful on the considered task. IGP is enhanced with the Operators Gradient Descent (OPGD) approach, which consists of embedding learnable parameters into the GP individuals. These parameters are optimized during and after the evolutionary process. Moreover, the OPGD approach is combined with the adjoint state method to evaluate the gradient of the objective function. The original OPGD was formulated by relying on the backpropagation technique for the gradient's evaluation, which is impractical in an optimization problem involving a dynamical system because of scalability and numerical errors. On the other hand, the adjoint method allows for overcoming this issue. Two experiments are formulated to test the proposed approach, named Operator Gradient Descent - Inclusive Genetic Programming (OPGD-IGP): the design of a Proportional–Derivative (PD) control law for a harmonic oscillator and the design of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control law for an inverted pendulum on a cart. OPGD-IGP proved successful in both experiments, being capable of autonomously designing an interpretable control law similar to the optimal ones, both in terms of shape and control gains. © 2024 The Author(s)","Adjoint state method; Control; Genetic Programming; Gradient descent","Control theory; Dynamical systems; Genetic algorithms; Gradient methods; Inverted pendulum; Adjoint state method; Adjoints; Automatic design; Control laws; Control schemes; Design tasks; Genetic programming algorithms; Gradient-descent; Local search; Scheme design; Genetic programming","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192055473"

Once learners do not have sufficient understanding of knowledge association or do not implement the topological order of knowledge advancement, they are prone to burnout in the learning process, forming serious negative emotions, which is not conducive to learning effectiveness, and even premature dropout. This is clearly a psychological teaching problem, that is our research objectives. This study focuses on the STEM learning behaviors in MOOCs, and explores the deep learning routing. We design one novel method to process the context features and content features for knowledge concept recommendation. Multiple entities, features, and courses enable the construction and optimization of knowledge concept relationships. Then, an attention mechanism is used to achieve the knowledge concept propagation between different entities. The extensive experiments have proved this method might accurately capture potential interests of knowledge concepts, achieve the effective deep learning routing, and explore and guide the positive learning state, reduce or avoid the negative psychological outcomes, such as dropout or low pass rate.

As industries continue to adopt these methods in areas that increasingly require end-user input and confirmation, the need to explain the internal decisions being made has grown. In this article, we present our approach to the extraction of explanation supporting features using trajectory mining. This is achieved through the application of principal components analysis techniques to identify new methods of tracking population diversity changes post-runtime. The algorithm search trajectories were generated by solving a set of benchmark problems with a genetic algorithm and a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm and retaining all visited candidate solutions which were then projected to a lower dimensional sub-space. We also varied the selection pressure placed on high fitness solutions by altering the selection operators. Our results show that metrics derived from the projected sub-space algorithm search trajectories are capable of capturing key learning steps and how solution variable patterns that explain the fitness function may be captured in the principal component coefficients. A comparative study of variable importance rankings derived from a surrogate model built on the same dataset was also performed. The results show that both approaches are capable of identifying key features regarding variable interactions and their influence on fitness in a complimentary fashion. © 2023 The Authors.

Traditional screening methods, including mammography, MRI, ultrasound, and biopsies, while effective, often come with high costs and risks. Recently, thermal imaging has gained attention due to its minimal risks compared to mammography, although it is not widely adopted as a primary detection tool since it depends on identifying skin temperature changes and lesions. The advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has enhanced the effectiveness of breast cancer detection and diagnosis using this technology. In this study, a novel interpretable computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for breast cancer detection is proposed, leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) throughout its various phases. To achieve these goals, we proposed a new multi-objective optimization approach named the Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (HPSO) and Hybrid Spider Monkey Optimization algorithm (HSMO). These algorithms simultaneously combined the continuous and binary representations of PSO and SMO to effectively manage trade-offs between accuracy, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. We evaluated several CAD models and investigated the impact of handcrafted methods such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Gabor Filters, and Edge Detection. We further shed light on the effect of feature selection and optimization on feature attribution and model decision-making processes using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework, with a particular emphasis on cancer classification using the DMR-IR dataset. The results of our experiments demonstrate in all trials that the performance of the model is improved. With HSMO, our models achieved an accuracy of 98.27% and F1-score of 98.15% while selecting only 25.78% of the HOG features. This approach not only boosts the performance of CAD models but also ensures comprehensive interpretability. This method emerges as a promising and transparent tool for early breast cancer diagnosis. © 2024 by the authors.","binary; breast cancer detection; continuous; feature attribution; feature extraction; feature selection; HPSO; HSMO; hyperparameter tuning; multi-objective optimization; thermography; XAI","Diseases; Feature Selection; Gabor filters; Lung cancer; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammography; Oncology; Screening; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Ultrasonic imaging; Binary; Breast cancer detection; Continuous; Feature attribution; Features extraction; Features selection; Hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm; Hybrid spider monkey optimization algorithm; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Thermography; XAI; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207635177"

Fixed and max-pressure methods are commonly used in TSC systems owing to their high simplicity and good interpretability, but they respectively lack dynamic adaptability and automatic rule generation, possibly leading to low solution accuracy in complicated traffic environments. Meanwhile, meta-heuristic and black-box learning methods meet challenges in practice such as extensive computational time and poor interpretability. To this end, this paper proposes a new TSC method based on Genetic Programming (GP) to generate descriptive score rules automatically for switching phases of all signalized intersections in an urban transportation network. In the proposed method, switching phases of each signalized intersection type is formulated as a symbolic regression problem, and effective primitives are defined to facilitate GP to solve the problem. Experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks. The results have validated the effectiveness of our proposed GP based method compared to several state-of-the-art TSC methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability. © 2024","Genetic programming; Symbolic regression; Traffic signal control","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Traffic signals; Urban transportation; Control methods; Interpretability; Number of vehicles; Pressure methods; Signalized intersection; Symbolic regression; Traffic signal control; Traffic signal control system; Urban areas; Urban networks; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192989951"

Accurate and timely assessment of rockburst risk can avoid unnecessary casualties and property losses. Despite the existence of various methods for rockburst assessment, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive and reliable criterion that is easy to both apply and interpret. Developing a new rockburst criterion based on simple parameters can potentially fill this gap. With its advantages, this criterion can facilitate a more effective and efficient prediction of rockburst potential, thereby contributing significantly to enhancing safety measures. In this paper, combined with the internal and external factors of rockburst, four control variables (i.e., integrity index, stress index, brittleness index, and elastic energy index) were selected to be incorporated into a comprehensive rockburstability index (RBSI). Based on 116 sets of rockburst cases, the rockburst potential was accurately quantified and predicted using the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model and the nature-inspired metaheuristic African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA). In its performance validation, the criterion achieved the highest accuracy of 90.48%, verifying the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed RBSI criterion. Additionally, an interpretive method was applied to analyze the variable influence on the criterion, facilitating the explanation of predictions and the analysis of the formula's robustness under different conditions. In general, compared with existing criterion methods involving relevant indicators, the newly proposed RBSI criterion enhances the accuracy of rockburst potential prediction, and it can effectively and swiftly evaluate the preliminary risk of rockburst. Lastly, a graphical user interface was developed to provide a clear visualization of the assessment of rockburst potential. © 2024","CatBoost; Graphical user interface; Metaheuristic optimization; Model interpretation; Rockburst criterion","Biomimetics; Forecasting; Fracture mechanics; Optimization; Risk assessment; Underground structures; Categorical boosting; Great depth; Hard rocks; Meta-heuristic techniques; Metaheuristic optimization; Model interpretations; Prediction criterions; Rock engineering; Rockburst criteria; Rockburst prediction; algorithm; hard rock; modeling; risk assessment; rockburst; software; Graphical user interfaces","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196952034"

Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Ensemble learning; Finishing; Interpretable machine learning; Polishing; Surface roughness prediction; Ultra-precision machining","Costs; Deep learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Jets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Polishing; Regression analysis; Abrasive waterjets; Differential evolution algorithms; Ensemble learning; Interpretable machine learning; Jet polishing; Machine-learning; Prediction accuracy; Roughness predictions; Surface roughness prediction; Ultraprecision machining; Surface roughness","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165252925"

Coyoacán, Mexico, 04510, Mexico","In developing a theory of consciousness, one of the main problems has to do with determining what distinguishes conscious states from non-conscious ones—the delimitation problem. This paper explores the possibility of solving this problem in terms of self-awareness. That self-awareness is essential to understanding the nature of our conscious experience is perhaps the most widely discussed hypothesis in the study of consciousness throughout the history of philosophy. Its plausibility hinges on how the notion of self-awareness is unpacked. The idea that consciousness involves self-awareness has been understood in two different ways: either as awareness of oneself—the subject of experience—or as awareness of the conscious episode itself. In this paper I argue (i) that every experience concerns the subject in a very specific way, involving what I will call ‘perspectival de se representation’, and (ii) that there is no need to appeal to the experience itself in order to characterize the awareness within that experience. The view I articulate explains the subjective nature of experience without over-intellectualizing it, accommodates the phenomenology of experience, and dispels any doubt about the need to find the self in introspection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130821010"

Our study focuses on illuminating the evaluation processes for these models. We examine recent research, tracking current trends to ensure evaluation methods match the field’s rapid progress requirements. We analyze key evaluation dimensions, aiming to deeply understand factors affecting models performance.

However, antibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a Pre-trained Antibody generative large Language Model (PALM-H3) for the de novo generation of artificial antibodies heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) with desired antigen-binding specificity, reducing the reliance on natural antibodies. We also build a high-precision model antigen-antibody binder (A2binder) that pairs antigen epitope sequences with antibody sequences to predict binding specificity and affinity. PALM-H3-generated antibodies exhibit binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the emerging XBB variant, as confirmed through in-silico analysis and in-vitro assays. The in-vitro assays validate that PALM-H3-generated antibodies achieve high binding affinity and potent neutralization capability against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and the emerging XBB variant. Meanwhile, A2binder demonstrates exceptional predictive performance on binding specificity for various epitopes and variants. Furthermore, by incorporating the attention mechanism inherent in the Roformer architecture into the PALM-H3 model, we improve its interpretability, providing crucial insights into the fundamental principles of antibody design. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Artificial Intelligence; Complementarity Determining Regions; COVID-19; Epitopes; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Delta; Nigeria; complementarity determining region 3; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; immunoglobulin heavy chain; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; unclassified drug; virus antigen; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; neutralizing antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; antibody; antigen; architecture; language; neutralization; severe acute respiratory syndrome; antibody production; antigen binding; antigen specificity; Article; binding affinity; computer model; controlled study; human; in vitro study; large language model; mouse; nonhuman; rat; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1 (isolate hCoV-19/South Korea/KDCA43428/2022); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus neutralization; wild type; artificial intelligence; chemistry; complementarity determining region; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics; immunology; virology","","Nature Research","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200970034"

Nevertheless, the majority of AI models employed in this context were characterized by a lack of transparency. To address these concerns, we aim to design an interpretable tool to automate human embryo evaluation by combining artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 223 human blastocyst time-lapse (TL) images taken at 110 hours post-injection. All the images were evaluated by five embryologists from different clinics in terms of blastocyst expansion (BE), quality of the inner cell mass (ICM), and trophectoderm (TE). The embryo database was used to develop an AI system (70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test) for automate blastocyst assessment. The entire set of images underwent a standardization process, followed by processing and segmentation using Matlab software. The resulting quantified variables were utilized in AI techniques (ANN and GA). Finally, the accuracy and performance of the automation tool was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Then, the level of agreement among embryologists and between embryologists and the AI system was compared with Kappa Index. Results: The overall agreement among embryologists was low (Kappa: 0.4 for BE; and 0.3 for TE and ICM). The AI tool achieved higher consistency (Kappa 0.7 for BE and ICM; and 0.4 for TE). The AI exhibited high accuracy in classifying BE (test 81.5%), ICM (test 78.8%), and TE (test 78.3%) and better performance for BE (AUC 0.888-0.956) than for ICM (AUC 0.605-0.854) and TE (AUC 0.726-0.769) assessment. Conclusion: Our AI tool highlighted the superior consistency of AI compared to human operators in grading blastocyst morphology. This research represents an important step towards fully automating objective embryo evaluation. © 2024, Royan Institute (ACECR).

These CtB-LLMs are democratizing access to trainable Very Large-Language Models (VLLMs) and, thus, may represent the building blocks of many NLP systems solving downstream tasks. Hence, a little or a large bias in CtB-LLMs may cause significant harm. In this paper, we performed a large investigation of the bias of three families of CtB-LLMs, and we showed that debiasing techniques are effective and usable. Indeed, according to current tests, the LLaMA and the OPT families have an important bias in gender, race, religion, and profession. In contrast to the analysis for other LLMs, we discovered that bias depends not on the number of parameters but on the perplexity. Finally, the debiasing of OPT using LoRA reduces bias up to 4.12 points in the normalized stereotype score. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Building blockes; Current test; De-biasing; Down-stream; Language model; Language processing; Natural language understanding; NLP systems; Significant harm; System solving","Bollegala D.; Bollegala D.; Shwartz V.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","SIGLEX - ACL Special Interest Group","13th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, StarSEM 2024","20 June 2024 through 21 June 2024","Mexico City","203465","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207834392"

Originality/value: The management literature still seeks to understand the different social and economic impacts that the introduction of large language models (LLM) has produced. It is now recognized that such models are not neutral; they carry a large portion of the biases and discriminations found in human language. If used as support in writing job descriptions, it can contribute negatively to the preservation of gender inequality among occupations and the perpetuation of the sexual division of labor. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses different LLMs embeddings to evaluate potential gender biases generated in job postings from two major platforms, LinkedIn and Vagas.com. More specifically, it evaluates gender biases and identifies the vectors’ sensitivity within the context of gender inequality analysis. Findings: The degree of consistency between architectures varies significantly as the words contained in job descriptions and the two gender vectors are altered, which means that even pretrained models might not be reliable to understand gender bias. This lack of consistency indicates that the evaluation of gender bias might be different depending on the parameters. Also, a high sensitivity to pronouns was observed, and the difference between genders seems to be greater when we relate the unitary vectors “man” and “woman” with terms related to family. Contribution/implication: The use of LLM for job postings must be carried out with caution, and efforts to mitigate gender biases must take place on the corpus to be modeled before data training occurs. © 2024 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

One of the major issues for ED is the low-resource problem due to inadequate samples. Some studies address the low-resource issue with retrieving knowledge entries directly from knowledge bases while introducing a lot of irrelevant knowledge or failing the lookup. Moreover, recent work has attempted to employ large language models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) that directly access event types in unstructured text under low-resource scenarios. Although LLM-based approaches have obtained promising results, we consider that the full potential of LLMs has not been activated due to insufficient prompt information. Our research proposes a two-stage event detection method that collaborates small language models (SLMs) and LLMs, namely LSLAED. Specifically, we first fine-tune the SLM to generate three types of latent answers: answer-aware examples, structure-aware examples, and corresponding answer candidates. Subsequently, all latent answers will form the prompt and enable the LLM to improve performance through in-context learning. We evaluate the proposed method using precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Experiments on the ACE2005 and ERE-EN datasets have demonstrated that LSLAED achieves significant improvement in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Event detection; Large language model; Latent answers; Small language model","Event Types; Events detection; Irrelevant knowledge; Language model; Large language model; Latent answer; Lookups; Small language model; Unstructured texts","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208275276"

The integrated model consists of five base models and a meta-model, which significantly improves the prediction performance. Specifically, the R2 value was improved by 9.19% and the error metrics MAE, MSE, MAPE, and CVRMSE were reduced by 69.47%, 79.88%, 67.32%, and 57.02%, respectively, compared to the single prediction model.

In the multi-objective optimisation part, we used the NSGA-III algorithm to successfully improve the energy efficiency, daylight utilisation and thermal comfort of the building. Specifically, the optimal design solution reduces the energy use intensity by 31.6 kWh/m2, improves the useful daylight index by 39%, and modulated the thermal comfort index, resulting in a decrement of 0.69 °C for the summer season and an enhancement of 0.64 °C for the winter season, respectively.

It offers improved post-cracking performance, increased fracture resistance, and efficient stress transfer by incorporating steel fibers into the concrete mix. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used to accurately estimate concrete qualities, thus reducing time and costs. This research focuses on a novel hybrid machine learning model that such as Gaussian process regression with genetic algorithm (GPR-GA), Random Forest with genetic algorithm (RF-GA), and extreme gradient boosting with genetic algorithm (XGB-GA) to predict the compressive strength of SFRC. The proposed hybrid ML models demonstrate superior performance with an R2 value over 0.92 at both the training and testing stages. Specifically, the R2 value was found to be 0.9804 for GPR-GA, 0.9204 for RF-GA, and 0.9706 for XGB-GA. The RMSE values for GPR-GA, RF-GA, and XGB-GA were 8.38, 16.88, and 16.88, respectively. The overall GPR-GA model outperformed compare to the other two hybrid machine learning models, XGB-GA and RF-GA. Additionally, the SHAP method was utilized to assess the influence of input variables on the predicted compressive strength (CS) of SRFC. From the SHAP analysis, it was found that the temperature and diameter input parameters had the highest influence on the predicted CS compared to other input features. The proposed hybrid ML models provide builders and designers with a flexible and effective tool for analyzing characteristics and making accurate forecasts of the compressive strength of SFRC under high temperatures in building applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Compressive strength; Machine learning; SHAP analysis; Steel fiber reinforced concrete","Adaptive boosting; Adversarial machine learning; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Fiber reinforced plastics; Gaussian distribution; Random forests; Regression analysis; Reinforcement learning; Gaussian process regression; Hybrid machine learning; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Random forests; SHAP analyze; Shapley; Steel fiber reinforced concretes; Fiber reinforced concrete","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209227829"

The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model. The utilization of explainable AI and motifs has led to the proposal of two novel operators, namely p-crossover and p-mutation.

It is becoming an urgent problem to evaluate the safety condition of bridge structures combining inspection data with artificial intelligence methods. This paper proposes a data-driven capacity assessment framework for existing RC bridges. The load capacity limit state (LCLS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) prediction model are established based on the proposed information fusion machine learning model. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimized support vector machine (SVM) learner is established to capture the relationship between the feature variables and the LSLS or SLS. Forty-five samples are obtained by static and dynamic simulation of the ANSYS models. Five-dimensional parameters are adopted as the key input parameters of the model, including the maximum dynamic deflection, crack opening ratio, and crack normal damage ratio at midspan, 1/4 span, and 3/4 span. The Shapley additive explanations method is proposed to conduct parameters sensitivity analysis. The results show that the GA-SVM regression algorithm in LCLS and SLS reduction factor prediction is better than the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The crack opening ratio is the most critical parameter that can considerably affect the outcomes of the LCLS and SLS prediction. © Korean Society of Civil Engineers 2024.","Bridge engineering; Finite element model; Genetic algorithm; Load bearing capacity; Support vector machine","Finite element method; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Reinforced concrete; Sensitivity analysis; Support vector machines; Bridge engineering; Existing reinforced concrete; Finite element modelling (FEM); Limit state; Load capacity limits; Load-bearing capacity; Reinforced concrete bridge; Serviceability limit state; State prediction; Support vectors machine; Genetic algorithms","","Korean Society of Civil Engineers","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200869621"

Surrogate-assisted selection plays a pivotal role in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), especially in addressing expensive optimization problems by reducing the number of real function evaluations. However, whether LLMs can serve as surrogate models remains an unknown. In this study, we propose a novel surrogate model based purely on LLM inference capabilities, eliminating the need for training. Specifically, we formulate model-assisted selection as a classification problem or a regression problem, utilizing LLMs to directly evaluate the quality of new solutions based on historical data. This involves predicting whether a solution is good or bad, or approximating its value. This approach is then integrated into EAs, termed LLM-assisted EA (LAEA). Detailed experiments compared the visualization results of 2D data from 9 mainstream LLMs, as well as their performance on 5-10 dimensional problems. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have significant potential as surrogate models in evolutionary computation, achieving performance comparable to traditional surrogate models only using inference. This work offers new insights into the application of LLMs in evolutionary computation.

One of the main challenges in data anonymization is achieving a balance between ensuring data privacy and maintaining data utility. To address these challenges, recent studies have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown improved performance on datasets from Europe. Based on these findings, this paper aims to create a dataset from less explored parts of the world, specifically Africa, to assess the relevance of LLMs on diverse datasets and to discuss the generalization of the results. Additionally, this paper proposes an evaluation framework for assessing various anonymization techniques, including those utilizing LLMs. The performance of these techniques is assessed using several metrics, such as BERTScore for semantic evaluation and Information Loss for utility preservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V..

The objectives of this study are to identify factors associated with early de-escalation and to analyse the impact of de-escalation on mortality in patients with Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (BSI) with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2. Methods: A prospective, multicentre cohort study was performed including episodes of BSI due to Enterobacterales and a SOFA score ≥ 2 who were receiving an active antipseudomonal β-lactam; the isolate should be susceptible to at least 1 narrower-spectrum antibiotic. Variables associated with de-escalation were identified using logistic binary regression. The association of de-escalation with 30-day mortality was investigated. Confounding was controlled by calculating a propensity score used as covariate, as matching variable, and for inverse probability treatment weighting. Results: Of the 582 patients included, de-escalation was performed in 311 (53.4%). Neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.18–0.75), central venous catheter (aOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.32–0.83), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing isolate (aOR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.17–0.48) were negatively associated with de-escalation, and urinary tract source was positively associated (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.56–3.33). The 30-day mortality was 6.8% (21 patients) in de-escalated patients and 14.4% (39) in not de-escalated patients (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI = 0.44–0.89). In multivariate analysis including the propensity score, de-escalation was not associated with mortality (AOR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.39–2.47) and was protective in the case of urinary or biliary tract source (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.09–1.06). Matched and inverse probability treatment weighting analysis showed similar results. Conclusions: These results suggest that early de-escalation from antipseudomonal β-lactams is safe in patients with Enterobacterales bacteremia and SOFA ≥ 2. © 2024","Bacteremia; Enterobacterales; Severe infection; SOFA score","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; beta lactam antibiotic; cefepime; ceftazidime; cephalosporin derivative; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; imipenem; meropenem; piperacillin plus tazobactam; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antiinfective agent; adult; age; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; biliary tract infection; bloodstream infection; catheter-related bacteremia; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; Enterobacterales; Escherichia coli; female; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; Klebsiella pneumoniae; major clinical study; male; mortality; neutropenia; post hoc analysis; predictive value; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; septic shock; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival; treatment duration; urinary tract infection; bacteremia; clinical trial; drug effect; drug therapy; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; very elderly","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205022213"

Utilizing the model's extensive context capacity for iterative prompting without feedback, we sought to autonomously generate superior algorithmic versions. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the improvements did not progress linearly. Nevertheless, one iteration stood out significantly, consistently outperforming the baseline across various pairwise comparisons and showing a robust performance profile. This iteration's structure deviated substantially from traditional SOMA principles, underscoring the potential of large language models to create distinctive and effective algorithmic strategies. The results affirm the methodology's ability to produce high-performing algorithms without expert intervention, setting the stage for future research to integrate feedback mechanisms and conduct detailed code analyses to understand further the modifications made by the Large Language Models.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Yet, their predominantly English-centric training has led to biases and performance disparities across languages. This imbalance marginalizes minoritized languages, making equitable access to NLP technologies more difficult for languages with lower resources, such as Galician. We present the first two generative LLMs focused on Galician to bridge this gap. These models, freely available as open-source resources, were trained using a GPT architecture with 1.3B parameters on a corpus of 2.1B words. Leveraging continual pretraining, we adapt to Galician two existing LLMs trained on larger corpora, thus mitigating the data constraints that would arise if the training were performed from scratch. The models were evaluated using human judgments and task-based datasets from standardized benchmarks. These evaluations reveal a promising performance, underscoring the importance of linguistic diversity in generative models. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.","continual pertaining; Galician; large language models; open access","","","Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206538925"

We focused on the differences in physical, rather than chemical, properties between EC- and PC-based solvents to explain the differences in the interphase formation properties on the graphitic anode. By probing solid–liquid interfaces before solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, we attributed the difference to the hindered kinetics of solvated Li+ co-intercalation into graphite at the early stage of SEI formation on the EC-graphite interface. This hindrance is due to enrichment of the interfacial region with EC molecules, which increases the local liquidus temperature of the electrolyte (Tm = 36.4 °C for EC and −48.8 °C for PC), as evidenced by the increased interfacial stiffness. The absence of such kinetic limitations for solvated Li+ ion intercalation in the PC electrolyte leads to a higher degree of co-intercalation of solvated molecules into graphite, resulting in severe graphite expansion upon reduction, followed by the SEI cracking along the edge plane. The following continuous co-intercalation of solvated Li+ closes the “co-intercalation-expansion-cracking” loop. This explains why a pure PC electrolyte cannot form a stable SEI on graphite. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024.","","Carbonates; Carbonation; Intercalation; Selenium compounds; Co-intercalation; Ethylene carbonate; Graphitic anode; Interface stiffness; Ion batteries; Li +; Property; Propylene carbonate; Propylene carbonate electrolyte; Solid electrolyte interphase; Solid electrolytes","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206513989"

However, generating effective test cases for training and evaluating GP programs requires strong domain knowledge. Furthermore, GP programs often prematurely converge on local optima when given excessively difficult problems early in their training. Curriculum learning (CL) has been effective in addressing similar issues across different reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but it requires the manual generation of progressively difficult test cases as well as their careful scheduling. In this work, we leverage the domain knowledge and the strong generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate effective test cases of increasing difficulties and schedule them according to various curricula. We show that by integrating a curriculum scheduler with LLM-generated test cases we can effectively train a GP agent player with environments-based curricula for a single-player game and opponent-based curricula for a multi-player game. Finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing this method for other problem domains. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, due to its focus on collectivities, securitization theory cannot tell us why leaders choose either securitization or desecuritization. Understanding this choice is crucial because (de)securitization processes can prescribe possible foreign policy options and thus affect the likelihood of conflict and cooperation. To account for leaders’ choices, I draw on political psychology and demonstrate the utility of my approach through an explanation of two US presidents’ preferences for (de)securitizing North Korea. Using leadership trait and operational code analysis, I show that psychological variables shaped Bill Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s preferences because they affected their threat perception and inclination toward conflictual or cooperative actions. These preferences had substantial consequences: While Clinton’s desecuritization attempt led to improvements in US–North Korean relations, Bush’s effort to resecuritize North Korea effectively reversed this progress. © The Author(s) (2024).","","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193613194"

Therefore, this research presents an integrated deep learning-based framework for soil moisture prediction, where long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, an attention mechanism, and fully connected layers are combined. In this framework, LSTM layers are applied to extract the complicated, long- and short-term dependencies from the time series soil moisture data. Besides, the attention mechanism is employed to learn the discriminative information from the extracted features. The genetic algorithm (GA), which aims to enhance the prediction accuracy, is applied to simultaneously determine the hyperparameters of the proposed network, called the GA-LSTM-ATT, consisting of the LSTM layer count, the hidden units in layers, the rate of dropout, and the learning rate. The experimental consequences have indicated that the GA-LSTM-ATT method outperforms the benchmark approaches in different evaluation indices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Genetic algorithm; Soil moisture prediction","Crops; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Soil moisture; Water resources; Agricultural activities; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Learning methods; Memory layers; Moisture data; Soil moisture predictions; Term dependency; Times series; Waters resources; Genetic algorithms","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176551046"

Predicting WHF in a phase that is currently undiagnosable by physicians would enable prompt treatment of such events in patients at a higher risk of WHF. Although the role of Artificial Intelligence in cardiovascular diseases is becoming part of clinical practice, especially for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, its usage is often considered not completely reliable due to the incapacity of these models to provide a valid explanation about their output results. Physicians are often reluctant to make decisions based on unjustified results and see these models as black boxes. This study aims to develop a novel diagnostic model capable of predicting WHF while also providing an easy interpretation of the outcomes. We propose a threshold-based binary classifier built on a mathematical model derived from the Genetic Programming approach. This model clearly indicates that WHF is closely linked to creatinine, sPAP, and CAD, even though the relationship of these variables and WHF is almost complex. However, the proposed mathematical model allows for providing a 3D graphical representation, which medical staff can use to better understand the clinical situation of patients. Experiments conducted using retrospectively collected data from 519 patients treated at the HF Clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model, surpassing the most commonly used machine learning algorithms. Indeed, the proposed GP-based classifier achieved a 96% average score for all considered evaluation metrics and fully supported the controls of medical staff. Our solution has the potential to impact clinical practice for HF by identifying patients at high risk of WHF and facilitating more rapid diagnosis, targeted treatment, and a reduction in hospitalizations. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial Intelligence; Explainable classification; Explainable diagnosis; Genetic programming; Heart failure; Worsening Heart Failure","Aged; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Cardiovascular; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Patient treatment; creatinine; diuretic agent; Cardiovascular disease; Clinical practices; Decision-based; Diagnostics and prognostics; Explainable classification; Explainable diagnose; Health systems; Heart failure; Worsening heart failure; aged; Article; clinical practice; creatinine blood level; disease classification; disease exacerbation; female; heart failure; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; biological model; genetics; heart failure; middle aged; Genetic programming","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203149093"

However, with the increase in the dimensions of process parameters and the number of samples, the relationship between process parameters and molten pool often exhibits high levels of uncertainty and nonlinearity. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used for complex LW systems modeling, but they may be limited and unable to fully capture the complex relationships when faced with complex systems. Additionally, traditional ML techniques may lack interpretability within the model, making it difficult to understand the input features and their impact on the output. To address these issues, a method that combines an interpretable multi-task neural network (MTNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Firstly, an LW experimental platform is constructed, and the orthogonal design is conducted for data collection. In the data preparation stage, the curriculum learning strategy is employed to reorganize the raw experimental data. Subsequently, the MTNN is constructed to automatically learn feature representations among input process parameters, capture nonlinear relationships between data, and share weights across multiple related tasks to improve efficiency and performance. Furthermore, the PSO is designed to determine the constraints and objective functions. In addition, the shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is utilized to calculate the importance of process parameters and enhance the interpretability.

However, the underlying mechanisms of B. pumilus strains remain unclear as to how they are beneficial for plants as stress tolerant and growth promoters. Bacillus pumilus was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Artemisia vulgaris. NGS (next-generation sequencing) was performed for the strain to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbial interactions. NGS revealed 3,910 genes, 3294 genes with protein-coding, and 11 functional genomic regions related to diverse agronomic traits including stress tolerance. We identified the two possible phytohormone biosynthesis approaches from metabolic regions1(terpense→diterpense→betacarotene→xanthoxin→ABA)2(terpense→diterpense→geranyl diphosphate →C20 →GA). Several gene clusters related to the biosynthesis of phytohormones, stress tolerance, and agricultural diversification were predicted. The genome provides insights into the possible mechanisms of this bacterium for stress tolerance and its future applications. The genomic organization of B. pumilus revealed several hallmarks of its plant growth promotion and pathogen suppression activities. Our results provide detailed genomic information for the strain and reveal its potential stress tolerance mechanisms, laying the foundation for developing effective stress tolerance strategies against abiotic stress. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bacillus pumilus; Food security; NGS; Secondary metabolites","Abscisic Acid; Bacillus pumilus; Genome, Bacterial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Multigene Family; Plant Growth Regulators; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology; Stress, Physiological; abscisic acid; phytohormone; Bacillus pumilus; bacterial genome; biosynthesis; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; microbiology; multigene family; physiological stress; rhizosphere","","Nature Research","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209747300"

The existing methods of automated program repair leave a lot of room for improvement. Fault localization, which aims to find lines of code that are potentially buggy, minimises the search space of an automated program repair system. Recent work has shown improvement in these fault localization methods, with the use of Large Language Models. Here, we propose a system where a LLM-based fault localization tool, which we call SemiAutoFL, is used within a fully automatic program repair program, ARJA-e. We show that utilising LLM-based fault localization with ARJA-e can significantly improve its performance on real world bugs. ARJA-e with SemiAutoFL can repair 10 bugs that ARJA-e was previously unable to so do. This finding adds to our understanding of how to improve fault localization and automated program repair, highlighting the potential for more efficient and accurate fault localisation methods being applied to automated program repair. © 2024 is held by the owner/author(s).","fault localisation; genetic improvement; large language models","Automatic programming; Computer debugging; Automatic programs; Fault localization; Genetic improvements; Language model; Large language model; Line of codes; Localization method; Repair program; Repair system; Search spaces; Program debugging","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (ACM SIGEVO)","2024 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2024 Companion","14 July 2024 through 18 July 2024","Melbourne","201625","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201966223"

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson's ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Architectured materials; Design inspiration; Generative design; Periodic microstructures; Stochastic microstructures; XAI","Design; Generative adversarial networks; Metamaterials; Stochastic systems; Architectured materials; De novo design; Design inspiration; Generative design; Microstructure design; Periodic microstructure; Periodic pattern; Property; Stochastic microstructures; XAI; Poisson ratio","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210369045"

However, PV power generation is entirely dependent on the amount of downward solar radiation reaching the solar cells. This is determined by uncertain and uncontrollable meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, as well as other factors such as topographical characteristics. Good solar radiation prediction models can increase energy output while decreasing the operation costs of PV power generation. For example, in some provinces in China, PV stations are required to upload short-term online power forecast information to power dispatching agencies. Numerous AI, statistical, and numerical weather prediction models have been used in many real-world renewable energy applications, with a focus on modeling accuracy. However, there is a need for explainable AI models that could be easily understood, analyzed, and augmented by the stakeholders. In this article, we present a compact, explainable, and lifelong learning metaheuristic-based interval type-2 fuzzy logic system for solar radiation modeling. The generated model will be composed of a small number of short IF-Then rules that have been optimized via simulated annealing to produce models with high prediction accuracy. These models are updated through a life-long learning approach to maximize their accuracy and maintain interpretability. In the process of lifelong learning, the proposed method transferred the model's knowledge to new geographical locations with minimal forgetting. The proposed method achieved good prediction accuracy and outperformed on new geographical locations other transparent and black-box models by 13.2% as well as maintaining excellent generalization ability. The resulting models have been evaluated and accepted by experts, and thanks to the generated transparency, the experts were able to augment the models with their expertise, which increased the models' accuracy.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Explainable AI (XAI); solar energy; type-2 fuzzy systems","Electric load dispatching; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Numerical models; Simulated annealing; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Weather forecasting; Wind; Geographical locations; Life long learning; Metaheuristic; Modeling accuracy; Photovoltaic power generation; Prediction accuracy; Predictive models; Solar radiation model; Type-2 fuzzy systems; XAI; Solar energy","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182353761"

One of the main approaches is genetic algorithms (GAs). However, due to their complexity, users may need help understanding or communicating GA applications, preventing their widespread acceptance among factory workers. The concept of explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to address this issue. This study reviews existing XAI techniques for explaining GA applications in job scheduling and summarizes the problems existing XAI techniques face. Several novel XAI techniques are proposed to solve these problems, including decision tree-based interpretation, dynamic transformation and contribution diagrams, and improved bar charts. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, it is applied to a case from the literature. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology can compensate for the deficiencies of existing XAI methods in handling high-dimensional data and visualizing the contribution of feasible solutions, thereby satisfying all the requirements for an effective XAI technique for explaining GA applications in job scheduling. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to explain other evolutionary AI applications in job scheduling, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Job scheduling","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling algorithms; Artificial intelligence technologies; Bar chart; Dynamic transformation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Feasible solution; Genetic algorithm application; High dimensional data; Jobs scheduling; Tree-based; Workers'; Genetic algorithms","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170650009"

This enables EXA-GP to utilize the full suite of optimizations provided by EXAMM, such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, island based populations with re-population events, as well as Lamarckian weight inheritance and backpropagation for optimization of constant values. Results show that EXA-GP's evolved genetic programs achieve the same levels of accuracy as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) evolved by EXAMM, while at the same time being more explainable. EXA-GP's genetic programs are also computationally less complex than EXAMM's RNNs, suggesting that GP operations may actually be more effective than gated recurrent memory cells for time series forecasting. We also show that EXAMM and EXA-GP outperform state-of-the-art GP and recurrent CGPANN algorithms which struggle on these benchmarks.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","graph-based genetic programming; neuroevolution; recurrent neural networks; time series forecasting","Benchmarking; Genes; Genetic programming; Graph neural networks; Neurons; Evolutionary exploration; Genetic programming algorithms; Genetic programs; Graph-based; Graph-based genetic programming; Memory cell; Neural-networks; Neuro evolutions; Optimisations; Time series forecasting; Recurrent neural networks","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (ACM SIGEVO)","2024 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2024 Companion","14 July 2024 through 18 July 2024","Melbourne","201625","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201937679"

High ischemic risk was defined as having a history of diabetes or chronic kidney disease, multivessel PCI, at least 3 lesions treated, total stent length greater than 60 mm, at least 3 stents implanted, left main PCI, or bifurcation PCI with at least 2 stents. Data were collected from February 14, 2014, to January 21, 2021, and analyzed from December 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to either de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel or ticagrelor-based DAPT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemic outcomes (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis) and bleeding outcomes (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding) were evaluated. RESULTS Of 2697 patients with AMI (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [11.4] years; 454 [16.8%] female), 1371 (50.8%; 684 assigned to de-escalation and 687 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) had high ischemic risk features and a significantly higher risk of ischemic outcomes than those without high ischemic risk (1326 patients [49.2%], including 665 assigned to de-escalation and 661 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.15-2.63; P =.01). De-escalation to clopidogrel, compared with ticagrelor-based DAPT, showed no significant difference in ischemic risk across the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54-1.45; P =.62) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28; P =.21), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.47). The bleeding risk of the de-escalation group was consistent in both the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.11; P =.11) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.75; P =.003), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In stabilized patients with AMI, the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of an unguided de-escalation strategy with clopidogrel compared with a ticagrelor-based DAPT strategy were consistent without significant interaction, regardless of the presence of high ischemic risk. © 2023 American Medical Association.

Traditional diagnostic methods, based on visual examination, are subjective, time-intensive, and require specialized expertise. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for skin cancer detection face challenges such as computational inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and reliance on standalone CNN architectures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a comprehensive pipeline combining transfer learning, feature selection, and machine-learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy. Multiple pretrained CNN models were evaluated, with Xception emerging as the optimal choice for its balance of computational efficiency and performance. An ablation study further validated the effectiveness of freezing task-specific layers within the Xception architecture. Feature dimensionality was optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization, reducing dimensions from 1024 to 508, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Machine-learning classifiers, including Subspace KNN and Medium Gaussian SVM, further improved classification accuracy. Evaluated on the ISIC 2018 and HAM10000 datasets, the proposed pipeline achieved impressive accuracies of 98.5% and 86.1%, respectively. Moreover, Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM, LIME, and Occlusion Sensitivity, enhanced interpretability. This approach provides a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution for automated skin cancer diagnosis in clinical applications. © 2024 by the authors.","ablation; explainable-AI; feature extraction; feature selection; medium Gaussian SVM; particle swarm optimization; subspace KNN; transfer learning","Adversarial machine learning; Feature Selection; Gaussian distribution; Lung cancer; Transfer learning; Explainable-artificial intelligence; Features extraction; Features selection; Gaussians; Medium gaussian SVM; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Subspace KNN; Swarm optimization; Transfer learning; Ablation","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213436359"

In recent times, one of the deadliest respiratory diseases, COVID-19, which causes serious damage to the lungs has claimed a lot of lives globally. Machine learning-based systems can assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of the disease, which can reduce the deadly effects of the disease. For the successful deployment of these machine learning-based systems, hyperparameter-based optimization and feature selection are important issues. Motivated by the above, in this proposal, we design an improved model to predict the existence of respiratory disease among patients by incorporating hyperparameter optimization and feature selection. To optimize the parameters of the machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter optimization with a genetic algorithm is proposed and to reduce the size of the feature set, feature selection is performed using binary grey wolf optimization algorithm. Moreover, to enhance the efficacy of the predictions made by hyperparameter-optimized machine learning models, an ensemble model is proposed using a stacking classifier. Also, explainable AI was incorporated to define the feature importance by making use of Shapely adaptive explanations (SHAP) values. For the experimentation, the publicly accessible Mexico clinical dataset of COVID-19 was used. The results obtained show that the proposed model has superior prediction accuracy in comparison to its counterparts. Moreover, among all the hyperparameter-optimized algorithms, adaboost algorithm outperformed all the other hyperparameter-optimized algorithms. The various performance assessment metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, were used to assess the results. © 2024 Kaur et al.

In this study, the major factors causing the rapid loss of water storage during 2003–2020 are first investigated using correlation analysis, where the storage estimates are derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. The major hydroclimatic drivers of monthly water storage changes are then explored among precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (RO) using an interpretable deep learning (IDL) method. The relative contribution of each driver is quantified by leveraging the interpretability nature of IDL. Results show that the GWS depletion (–0.82 cm/year) primarily accounts for the TWS loss (–0.73 cm/year) in the Ordos Basin under increased precipitation. The decreased TWS and GWS are both closely related to the increased vegetation density and coal production, indicating that they are the major drivers of the long-term water loss. At the monthly scale, the IDL method reveals that P and ET contribute over 75% to the changes of both TWS and GWS in most regions. The response lag of TWS to P and ET is generally 1–3 months. In contrast, GWS shows a more complicated response to P and ET with a longer lag range of 1–11 months in different regions due to the complicated Ordos Basin aquifer systems. These findings achieve a better understanding of hydrologic cycles and better guide sustainable water resources management in the Ordos Basin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Association of Hydrogeologists.","Arid regions; China; GRACE; Groundwater storage; Interpretable deep learning","China; Ordos Basin; arid region; GRACE; groundwater; machine learning; satellite data; water storage","","Institute for Ionics","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171846650"

Predicting compressive strength (CS), a key mechanical property, is essential for optimal performance. Due to the nonlinear nature of FASC mixtures, researchers now utilize machine learning tools. This study evaluates three machine learning models by combining traditional AI algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), with nature-inspired optimization techniques, such as chicken swarm optimization (CSO), moth flame optimization algorithm (MOFA), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA). By addressing the gaps in mechanical property variation, dataset scope, and model comparison, this study demonstrated high accuracy in CS prediction for all three models. The ANN optimized by WOA consistently excelled across multiple metrics.

Here, we reported the long-term outcomes and post-hoc exploratory analyses. Methods: This single-arm, phase II trial enrolled 42 patients diagnosed with unresectable stage I–IVA ESCC was conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between November 2019 and January 2021. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy (weekly 50 mg/m2 of paclitaxel and 25 mg/m2 of cisplatin for five cycles), concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), and toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year). The primary endpoint was clinical complete response (CR) rate at 3 months after CRT completion. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were evaluated. Additionally, the exploratory objectives included analysing recurrence patterns, assessing the associations between immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and efficacy, and identifying potential predictors for irAEs. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04005170). Findings: With a median follow-up of 44.3 months (IQR 40.8–46.1), the 3-year OS and PFS rates were 44.8% (95% CI 31.9–62.8) and 35.7% (95% CI 23.8–53.6), respectively. Patients who failed to achieve a clinical complete response (CR) demonstrated significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 13.73, 95% CI 4.43–42.54, P < 0.0001) and PFS (HR = 32.08, 95% CI 8.57–120.10, P < 0.0001). Disease recurrence occurred in 23 of 42 patients (55%), with recurrences being earlier and more frequent in the non-CR group compared to the CR group. Patients experiencing irAEs showed a significantly higher CR rate (72% vs. 39%, P = 0.082) and better PFS (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19–0.93, P = 0.027) than those without irAEs. GON4L mutation was associated with a lower incidence of irAEs (P = 0.036).

Based on the full-dimensional description of flight incidents, the explainable module is added to the prediction model to achieve its accuracy, stability, and explainability. Firstly, imbalance processing is performed employing the sampling method, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for feature selection; these results are then considered as prediction model input. Secondly, an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost)-based incident severity prediction model is established with five categories of none, minor, serious, fatal, and total as prediction labels; real data is used for validation, and the model shows good robustness and superiority. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is introduced to explain the correlation between incidents severity and input features and to measure feature importance. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and robustness. Which can provide some decision-making reference for aviation operation management departments to emergencies, learn the deep-seated law of incidents, and promote the paradigm of active safety management. © IMechE 2023.","explainable machine learning; Flight incidents; GA-XGBoost; incident deep cognition; SHAP","Aircraft accidents; Decision making; Deep learning; Forecasting; Aviation application; Complex mechanisms; Explainable machine learning; Flight incident; Genetic algorithm-xgboost; Incident deep cognition; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Genetic algorithms","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176104974"

Despite SDP being proven as an effective defense strategy in various domains, it has yet to see wide-spread use due to its drawbacks. One of SDP's most pressing issues is the need for an expert to manually configure it for each unique application. Here we describe a novel system for designing SDP networks called SDPush which can automatically design and analyze possible configurations for a given network with user-specifications. Since there is not a systematic approach for account type design and assignment, we develop a two-step optimization system consisting of a bitstring genetic algorithm and a genetic programming sub-system for designing and evaluating SDP networks respectively. In order to evolve an SDP configuration exhibiting the user-specified characteristics while also minimizing security risk, we implement our system to support multi-objective search spaces by providing the system's training set with different cases aimed at evaluating different aspects of the network configuration.

The sharing of policy parameters can improve sampling efficiency and learning effectiveness, but it may lead to a lack of policy diversity. Hence, to balance parameter sharing and diversity among agents in COMA has been a persistent research topic. In this paper, an effective training method for a COMA policy network based on a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed, named DE-COMA. DE-COMA introduces individuals in a population as computational units to construct the policy network with operations such as mutation, crossover, and selection. The average return of DE-COMA is set as the fitness function, and the best individual of policy network will be chosen for the next generation. By maintaining better parameter sharing to enhance parameter diversity, multi-agent strategies will become more exploratory. To validate the effectiveness of DE-COMA, experiments were conducted in the StarCraft II environment with 2s_vs_1sc, 2s3z, 3m, and 8m battle scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-COMA significantly outperforms the traditional COMA and most other multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of win rate and convergence speed. © 2024 by the authors.","differential evolution; multi-agent; parameter sharing; reinforcement learning","Adversarial machine learning; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Counterfactuals; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Multi agent; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Network-based; Parameter sharing; Policy networks; Reinforcement learnings; Training methods; Contrastive Learning","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205314631"

The article then discusses and analyzes the examples and extent of the court's human rights impact on legislative/judicial branch decision-making and action in that key country. This is followed by the development of a set of analytical, multi-factorial, explanations for the two inter-connected puzzles that animate the enquiry in this article.

Currently, two AI techniques are leading the way: large language models (LLMs) and genetic programming (GP) methods—each with its strengths and weaknesses. While LLMs have shown success in program synthesis from a task description, they often struggle to generate the correct code due to ambiguity in task specifications, complex programming syntax, and lack of reliability in the generated code. Furthermore, their generative nature limits their ability to fix erroneous code with iterative LLM prompting. Grammar-guided genetic programming (G3P, i.e., one of the top GP methods) has been shown capable of evolving programs that fit a defined Backus–Naur-form (BNF) grammar based on a set of input/output tests that help guide the search process while ensuring that the generated code does not include calls to untrustworthy libraries or poorly structured snippets. However, G3P still faces issues generating code for complex tasks. A recent study attempting to combine both approaches (G3P and LLMs) by seeding an LLM-generated program into the initial population of the G3P has shown promising results. However, the approach rapidly loses the seeded information over the evolutionary process, which hinders its performance. In this work, we propose combining an LLM (specifically ChatGPT) with a many-objective G3P (MaOG3P) framework in two parts: (i) provide the LLM-generated code as a seed to the evolutionary process following a grammar-mapping phase that creates an avenue for program evolution and error correction; and (ii) leverage many-objective similarity measures towards the LLM-generated code to guide the search process throughout the evolution. The idea behind using the similarity measures is that the LLM-generated code is likely to be close to the correct fitting code. Our approach compels any generated program to adhere to the BNF grammar, ultimately mitigating security risks and improving code quality. Experiments on a well-known and widely used program synthesis dataset show that our approach successfully improves the synthesis of grammar-fitting code for several tasks. © 2024 by the authors.","grammar; grammar-guided genetic programming; large language models; multi-objective; program synthesis","Application programs; Computational linguistics; Error correction; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Artificial intelligence techniques; Evolutionary process; Grammar; Grammar guided genetic programming; Language model; Large language model; Multi objective; Program synthesis; Search process; Similarity measure; Genetic programming","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199639904"

IpT-SNC uses a two-layered spiking neural network (SNN) architecture in which weights of synapses are modeled using amplitude-modulated, time-varying Gaussian functions. Self-regulated particle swarm optimization (SRPSO) is used to update the amplitude, width, and centers of the Gaussian functions and thresholds of neurons in the output layer. IpT-SNC has been developed to improve the interpretability of spiking neural networks. The time-varying weights in IpT-SNC allow us to describe the rationale behind predictions in terms of specific input spikes. The performance of IpT-SNC is evaluated on ten benchmark datasets in the UCI machine learning repository and compared with the performance of other learning algorithms. According to the performance results, IpT-SNC enhances classification performance on testing datasets from a minimum of 0.5% to a maximum of 7.7%. The significance level of IpT-SNC with other learning algorithms is evaluated using statistical tests like the Friedman test and the paired t-test. Furthermore, on the challenging real-world BCI (Brain Computer Interface) competition IV dataset, IpT-SNC outperforms current classifiers by about 8% in terms of classification accuracy. The results indicate that IpT-SNC has better generalization performance than other algorithms. © 2024 by the authors.","classifier; interpretable; self-regulated particle swarm optimization; spiking neural network","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205105100"

Accurate surface roughness prediction can significantly influence the overall quality of the final components by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. Although various prediction methods have been explored in previous research, less attention has been given to explainable prediction methods for surface roughness. This paper proposes a surface roughness prediction model based on the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm with ensemble learning. It aims to elucidate the intrinsic correlation between processing parameters and surface roughness values in Multi-Jet Polishing (MJP) using explainable analysis methods. The proposed Ensemble Regression with Differential Evolution (ERDE) algorithm comprises two main modules: data processing and analytics, and ensemble model prediction. These modules investigate the surface roughness of MJP from the data and model levels, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of ERDE, MJP experiments were conducted on three-dimensional printed components of 316L stainless steel. The experimental data indicated that ERDE outperforms other existing algorithms, reducing the mean absolute percentage error by approximately 42 %. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Differential evolution algorithm; Ensemble learning; Explainable analysis; Polishing; Surface roughness prediction; Ultra-precision machining","3D printing; Data handling; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Polishing; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Ensemble learning; Explainable analyse; Jet polishing; Multi-jets; Prediction methods; Roughness predictions; Surface roughness prediction; Ultraprecision machining; Surface roughness","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186597627"

Continuously improving the performance of the prediction model is the key to ensuring the accuracy of the chiller energy consumption prediction. As a result, a new improved ensemble model of the chiller energy consumption prediction is proposed, based on the idea of algorithmic ensemble aided by an attention mechanism (AM). To guarantee that the proposed model can see information from many spatial and structural viewpoints, the improved ensemble model incorporates the benefits of several base prediction methods. The suggested approach chooses crucial features to simplify the model input by utilizing AM, thereby reducing the complexity of the samples. The improved ensemble model was experimentally verified in an actual multi-chiller system, and the results showed that the established model could obtain good prediction results. Finally, the proposed model was compared with existing, well-known prediction models. To evaluate the accuracy of these models, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), variance accounted for (VAF), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used as the evaluation indices. With an MAE of 2.858, an MAPE of 1.2755 %, an MSE of 20.1878, a VAF of 93.6058, and an R2 of 0.9923, the findings demonstrate that the improved ensemble model has a greater prediction accuracy than the other well-known prediction methods.

Studies demonstrate that BERT-based models achieve better performance in text classification problems. Large language models (LLMs) answer free-text queries without being specifically trained. This work aims to compare the performance of three variations of BERT models and LLMs (Google Bard, Microsoft Bing/GPT-4, and OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5) for identifying suicidal ideation from nonclinical texts written in Brazilian Portuguese. A dataset labeled by psychologists consisted of 2,691 sentences without suicidal ideation and 1,097 with suicidal ideation, of which 100 sentences were selected for testing. We applied data preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter optimization, and hold-out cross-validation for training and testing BERT models. When evaluating LLMs, we used zero-shot prompting engineering. Each test sentence was labeled if it contained suicidal ideation, according to the chatbot’s response. Bing/GPT-4 achieved the best performance, with 98% across all metrics. Fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the other LLMs: BERTimbau-Large performed the best with a 96% accuracy, followed by BERTimbau-Base with 94%, and BERT-Multilingual with 87%. Bard performed the worst with 62% accuracy, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 achieved 81%. The high recall capacity of the models suggests a low misclassification rate of at-risk patients, which is crucial to prevent missed interventions by professionals. However, despite their potential in supporting suicidal ideation detection, these models have not been validated in a patient monitoring clinical setting. Therefore, caution is advised when using the evaluated models as tools to assist healthcare professionals in detecting suicidal ideation. © 2024 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Zero-shot learning was utilized initially to assess the capabilities of these LLMs in de-identifying medical data. Subsequently, each model was fine-tuned with varying training set sizes to observe changes in performance. The study also investigates the impact of the specificity of prompts on the accuracy of de-identification tasks. Fine-tuning LLMs with specific examples significantly enhanced the accuracy of the de-identification process, surpassing the zero-shot learning accuracy of pre-trained counterparts. Notably, a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model with a few-shot learning technique was able to exceed the performance of a zero-shot learning GPT-4 model, with 99% accuracy. Detailed prompts resulted in higher task accuracy across all models, yet fine-tuned models with brief instructions still outperformed pre-trained models given detailed prompts. Also, the fine-tuned models were more resilient to medical record format change than the zero-shot models.

Traditional methods often employ either filter, wrapper, or embedded approaches, which have limitations in terms of robustness, computational load, or capability to capture complex interactions among features. Despite the utility of metaheuristic algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Whale Optimization (WOA) in feature selection, there still exists a gap in efficiently incorporating feature importance feedback into these processes. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates the strengths of PSO, FA, and WOA algorithms into an ensemble model and further enhances its performance by incorporating a Deep Q-Learning framework for relevance feedbacks. The Deep Q-Learning module intelligently updates feature importance based on model performance, thereby fine-tuning the selection process iteratively. Our ensemble model demonstrates substantial gains in effectiveness over traditional and individual metaheuristic approaches. Specifically, the proposed model achieved a 9.5% higher precision, an 8.5% higher accuracy, an 8.3% higher recall, a 4.9% higher AUC, and a 5.9% higher specificity across multiple software bug prediction datasets and samples. By resolving some of the key issues in existing feature selection methods and achieving superior performance metrics, this work paves the way for more robust and efficient machine learning models in various applications, from healthcare to natural language processing scenarios. This research provides an innovative framework for feature selection that promises not only superior performance but also offers a flexible architecture that can be adapted for a variety of machine learning challenges. © The Author(s) 2024.","","algorithm; area under the curve; article; Cetacea; controlled study; feature selection; feature selection algorithm; firefly algorithm; human; human experiment; machine learning; metaheuristics; natural language processing; particle swarm optimization; prediction; Q learning; software","","Nature Research","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187154015"

With the increasing emphasis on low-energy building mandates and sustainable construction practices, integrating energy performance simulation into the design process has become imperative. However, existing methods often struggle to handle the vast amount of design information and to explore optimal alternatives effectively. While recent approaches such as Building Information Models (BIM) and data-driven solutions show promise for energy analysis, they frequently lack transparency and robust design optimization capabilities, limiting their applicability in critical contexts within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) industry. In response to these challenges, this research proposes a novel prescriptive model aimed at addressing these limitations. The proposed methodology integrates building energy simulation with optimization techniques, utilizing BIM data and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The Genetic algorithm provides some optimized solutions, including different alternatives of geometry, material, electrical, and mechanical elements to help engineering for data-driven decision-making. This integration aims to develop a model that is both prescriptive and explainable for indoor building design. Leveraging the value engineering method, the proposed approach seeks to strike a balance between energy consumption, functionality, and cost. By doing so, it aims to enhance energy efficiency while providing tangible design optimization solutions. © 2024","BIM; Building energy consumption estimation; Explainable algorithm; Genetic algorithm; Prescriptive analysis","Architectural design; Cost engineering; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Structural design; Value engineering; Architectural parameters; Building energy consumption; Building energy consumption estimation; Building Information Modelling; Energy consumption optimization; Energy efficient building; Explainable algorithm; Modeling data; Prescriptive analyse; Space-based; Genetic algorithms","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194365785"

Research into providing explanations to users has shown that local explanation techniques provide more acceptable explanations to users than attempting to explain an entire model, as a user often does not need to understand the entirety of a model.This work builds on prior work in the field to produce a competitive method for high-fidelity local explanations utilising genetic programming. Two different data representations targeted towards both users with and without machine learning experience are evaluated.The experimental results show comparable fidelity to the state-of-the art, while exhibiting more comprehensible explanations due to including fewer features in each explanation. The method enables decomposable explanations that are easy to interpret, while still capturing non-linear relationships in the original model.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","explainable AI; genetic programming; machine learning","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Genetic programming; Barriers to adoption; Black boxes; Data representations; Explainable AI; Growing demand; High-fidelity; Learning experiences; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Public trust; Adversarial machine learning","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (ACM SIGEVO)","2024 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2024 Companion","14 July 2024 through 18 July 2024","Melbourne","201625","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201960815"

Current representations vary strongly in complexity and shape, depending on the application. Therefore, the number of domain-specific representations is rapidly growing, with some being altered and retuned constantly. These tailored representations raise the barriers for entry and method adaption, thus decelerating progress in application. Herein, we present a general algorithm capable of yielding a highly specific representation solely based on a given dataset. The algorithm utilizes structural queries and evolutionary methodologies to generate interpretable molecular fingerprints. These are highly suited for molecular machine learning, enabling the accurate prediction of reactivity, property, and biological activity. We demonstrate its native interpretability, allowing for the extraction of knowledge, such as reactivity trends. We anticipate that the evolutionary multipattern fingerprint (EvoMPF) will be used to discover structure-target relationships in different molecular sciences. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","evolutionary algorithm; explainable AI; molecular machine learning; molecular representation; QAPR; reaction prediction; SDG12: Responsible consumption and production; SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188208641"

This paper presents a novel method for counterfactual learning in the context of multivariate time series analysis and forecast. The primary objective is to uncover hidden causal relationships and identify potential interventions to achieve desired outcomes. The proposed methodology integrates genetic algorithms and rigorous causality tests to infer and validate counterfactual dependencies within temporal sequences. More specifically, we employ Granger causality to enhance the reliability of identified causal relationships, rigorously assessing their statistical significance. Then, genetic algorithms, in conjunction with quantile regression, are used to exploit these intricate causal relationships to project future scenarios. The synergy between genetic algorithms and causality tests ensures a thorough exploration of the temporal dynamics present in the data, revealing hidden dependencies and enabling the projection of outcomes under hypothetical interventions. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real-world data, showcasing its ability to handle complex causal relationships, revealing meaningful counterfactual insights, and allowing for the prediction of outcomes under hypothetical interventions. © 2024 IEEE.","Counterfactuals; Genetic Algorithms; Time-Series Forecast","Time series; Causal relationships; Causality test; Counterfactuals; Granger Causality; Multivariate time series; Multivariate time series analysis; Novel methods; Primary objective; Temporal sequences; Time series forecasts; Time series analysis","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","23rd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2024","17 December 2024 through 21 December 2024","Sanya","208084","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006506164"

First, the genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal hyperparameter combination of the model. Second, the predicted values of the BiLSTM model optimized by the genetic algorithm are compared with the predicted values of the existing methods and the unoptimized BiLSTM model using different evaluation indexes. Finally, the SHAP method is used to give the overall and local interpretation of the prediction results of the BiLSTM model. The experimental results show that the RMSE of the BiLSTM model optimized by the genetic algorithm is reduced by at least 3.05 %, the MAE is reduced by at least 2.75 %, the MAPE is reduced by at least 3.29 %, and the R2 is increased by at least 1.51%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the problem of ice-copper grade prediction, and the SHAP method is able to explain the output of the BiLSTM model efficiently and increase the transparency of the model.

Detecting AI-generated content is critical, which has prompted the technology to tell apart real images from the generated ones. However, the existing methods, such as CNND, LGrad, lack interpretability. Unlike traditional image classification, it is crucial to know why the image can be considered as AI-generated. We introduce a novel AI-generated image detector based on genetic programming (GP), prioritizing both interpretability and classification accuracy. This application of GP in this context emphasizes the need for interpretability in AI-generated content identification. Our GP-based approach not only achieves competitive classification accuracy but also provides transparent decision-making processes, bridging the interpretability gap. This method enhances trust and understanding in the AI-generated image detection process. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the potential of GP-based detectors for this unique task. This research contributes to improving the transparency and reliability of AI-generated image detection, holding implications for computer vision and image forensics. Our work emphasizes the pivotal role of interpretability in distinguishing AI-generated content and offers insights into the inner workings of such models and also achieves a good generation ability. © 2023 IEEE.","AI-generated image detection; Genetic Programming; Interpretability; Transparency","Decision making; Digital forensics; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Image enhancement; AI-generated image detection; Classification accuracy; Content identifications; Decision-making process; Human perception; Image detection; Image detector; Images classification; Interpretability; Real images; Transparency","Wang J.; He Y.; Dinh T.N.; Grant C.; Qiu M.; Pedrycz W.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Computer Society; Technology Innovation Institute; TWO SIGMA; US National Science Foundation (NSF)","23rd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2023","1 December 2023 through 4 December 2023","Shanghai","197121","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186142591"

Nevertheless, the impact of this strategy on outcomes based on sex remains unclear. Methods: This was a post-hoc analysis of the TALOS-AMI study. At 1 month after PCI, patients who remained adherent to aspirin and ticagrelor without experiencing major adverse events were randomized into either the de-escalation group (clopidogrel plus aspirin) or the active control group (ticagrelor plus aspirin) for an additional 12 months. The primary endpoint encompassed a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium bleeding type 2 or greater at 12 months after randomization. Results: Among the 2,697 patients included in this study, 454 (16.8%) were women. Women, characterized by older age and a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, impaired renal function, and non-ST-segment myocardial infarction, exhibited a lower primary endpoint at 12 months compared to men [adjusted hazards ratio (HR), 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37–0.95; P = 0.03]. Compare to the active control group, the de-escalation group demonstrated a reduced risk of the primary endpoint in both women (adjusted HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15–0.95; P = 0.039) and men (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40–0.79; P = 0.001) (interaction P = 0.46). Conclusions: In stabilized patients post-PCI with drug-eluting stents for acute myocardial infarction, the primary endpoint was lower among women compared to men. In this cohort, the benefits of an unguided de-escalation strategy from ticagrelor to clopidogrel were comparable in women and men. 2024 Shin, Jun, Kim, Kim, Park, Choo, Hwang, Lee, Oh, Kim, Yim, Ahn and Chang.","acute myocardial infarction; clopidogrel; drug-eluting stent; percutaneous coronary intervention; sex; ticagrelor","acetylsalicylic acid; clopidogrel; prasugrel; ticagrelor; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; arteriovenous malformation; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; bleeding tendency; body mass; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; coronary artery disease; drug withdrawal; dual antiplatelet therapy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart arrhythmia; heart infarction; heart rehabilitation; human; hypertension; intracranial aneurysm; kidney function; loading drug dose; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; post hoc analysis; sepsis; ST segment; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; stent thrombosis; target vessel revascularization; thrombocyte function; venous thromboembolism","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189331580"

In NEAT022 randomized trial, virologically suppressed persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, PWH) with high cardiovascular risk switched from protease inhibitors to dolutegravir either immediately (DTG-I) or after 48 weeks (DTG-D). Methods: Primary endpoint was incident hypertension at 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure; adverse events and discontinuations associated with high blood pressure; and factors associated with incident hypertension. Results: At baseline, 191 (46.4%) participants had hypertension and 24 persons without hypertension were receiving antihypertensive medications for other reasons. In the 197 PWH (n = 98, DTG-I arm; n = 99, DTG-D arm) without hypertension or antihypertensive agents at baseline, incidence rates per 100 person-years were 40.3 and 36.3 (DTG-I) and 34.7 and 52.0 (DTG-D) at 48 (P =. 5755) and 96 (P =. 2347) weeks. SBP or DBP changes did not differed between arms. DBP (mean, 95% confidence interval) significantly increased in both DTG-I (+2.78 mmHg [1.07-4.50], P =. 0016) and DTG-D (+2.29 mmHg [0.35-4.23], P =. 0211) arms in the first 48 weeks of exposure to dolutegravir. Four (3 under dolutegravir, 1 under protease inhibitors) participants discontinued study drugs due to adverse events associated with high blood pressure. Classical factors, but not treatment arm, were independently associated with incident hypertension. Conclusions: PWH at high risk for cardiovascular disease showed high rates of hypertension at baseline and after 96 weeks. Switching to dolutegravir did not negatively impact on the incidence of hypertension or blood pressure changes relative to continuing protease inhibitors.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This tool could reduce audit risk, which is a crucial task in external audits. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to create models that can predict the audit opinion a company will receive. In these studies, authors used statistics and machine learning models, and both non-financial (e.g. audit lag) and financial data (e.g. financial ratios, or absolute value items available from financial statements) to make predictions. In this study, the performance of the XGBoost model optimized by metaheuristics algorithms is examined and evaluated. This study compares the performance of six different metaheuristic algorithms used to tune the XGBoost model in two separate scenarios. The first scenario represents a realistic client portfolio, where a majority of the clients are known, while the second scenario simulates a new clients-only portfolio, a more difficult scenario where prior information such as audit lag is not available. The study uses a dataset of 12,690 observations of Serbian companies and their audit opinions from 2016 to 2019. The findings indicate an improvement over the benchmark due to a more optimized hyperparameter tuning process and the use of the iterative sine-cosine algorithm for the XGBoost model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Audit opinion prediction; Machine learning; SHAP value analysis; Sine cosine algorithm; XGBoost","Finance; Heuristic algorithms; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Optimization; Value engineering; Audit opinion prediction; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Metaheuristic; Performance; Prediction accuracy; SHAP value analyse; Sine-cosine algorithm; Xgboost; Forecasting","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175043979"

The comfort of patients referring to the emergency department is undeniable. Since emergency departments receive patients with internal ailments such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hypertension, chemical poisoning, and multiple systemic traumas. The emergency department nurse is required to play the role of advocate for these patients at higher risk. The primary goal of this study was to explain the process of playing the role of patient advocacy. Methods: This study was conducted qualitatively and using the grounded theory method. Seventeen nurses working in the emergency department from 4 selected hospitals of Gilan University of Medical Sciences based on the primary emergency centers in Rasht city were included in the study purposefully and using a theoretical sampling method. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews and indirect observation. Data were analyzed simultaneously using the Strauss and Corbin approach. At first, Maxqd-19 software was used to organize the data. Results: In the data analysis, two primary categories of condition complexity and prudent comprehensive care were identified with 6 and 3 subcategories, respectively. Playing the role of a nurse in patient advocacy in the emergency department is a dynamic and repetitive process. The combined concept of “work creation and prudent care of a comfortable life” was the clearest concept revealed in the data. It was the most abstract concept that covered all the concepts. The complicated conditions of the emergency department are the primary barrier to playing the role of nurse advocacy in the emergency department. Conclusion: In emergency department conditions, it is necessary to provide the conditions for the realization of the concept of the role of the nurse as the patient’s advocate with work creation and comprehensive care of life and comfort. Fundamental legislation in the health system seems necessary in playing the role of the nurse as a patient advocate. © 2023, Venezuelan Society of Pharmacology and Clinical and Therapeutic Pharmacology.

However, for the existing SOH estimation methods based on machine learning algorithms, the health features are manually extracted mainly based on personal experience, without algorithm-based automatic preferential selection. Thus, this study proposes a battery SOH estimation method based on the feature-importance ranking strategy and generalized regression neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-GRNN). Firstly, 19 vital features were extracted from charging voltage, charging current, temperature, and incremental capacity (IC) curves. Secondly, the importance indexes for these features were calculated and optimally ranked by fusing the machine learning algorithm (random forest) and statistical analysis (Pearson correlation coefficient). Accordingly, different combinations of high-ranking features were compared to determine the best number of the final feature set. Thirdly, the SOH estimation model is built by the PSO-GRNN algorithm with optimal 7 high-ranking features. Based on the publicly available NASA datasets, the proposed SOH estimation model was validated on the data from a single-cell battery. Furthermore, the datasets from three cells with different cycling test conditions were utilized, where the data from two cells and the other cell were alternately selected as the training and test sets, respectively. The SOH estimation errors (squared absolute error and mean squared error) for single-cell and multi-cell experiments were less than 1 % and 3 %, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust and can achieve accurate and lightweight SOH estimation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Feature-importance ranking; Generalized regression neural network (GRNN); Lithium-ion batteries; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); State of health (SOH)","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Correlation methods; Errors; Forestry; Ions; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mean square error; NASA; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Estimation methods; Feature-importance ranking; Generalized regression; Generalized regression neural network; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Regression neural networks; State of health; Swarm optimization; Lithium-ion batteries","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167836493"

A novel image inpainting method is proposed to intelligently predict and fill damaged areas for complete and continuous visualization of the image. First, in order to effectively solve the problem of color distortion caused by light refraction in underwater environments, the improved gated attention mechanism is used. This mechanism improves the local details by learning and weighting the important features of the image. Second, gated convolution automatically determines the degree of restoration for each pixel based on local features of the original image. It eliminates distractions such as low contrast and scattering, retaining more original detailed information. By doing so, image inpainting techniques improve the quality and visualization of underwater images. © 2023 IEEE.","Gated convolution; Image inpainting; Underwater images","Image enhancement; Underwater imaging; Visualization; Attention mechanisms; Color distortions; Color noise; Color-scattering; Gated convolution; Image defects; Image Inpainting; Light attenuation; Mechanism-based; Underwater image; Convolution","","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE; IEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Parallel Processing (TCPP); IEEE Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS); IEEE Hyper Intelligence Technical Committee (HI-TC); IEEE TCSC","29th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, ICPADS 2023","17 December 2023 through 21 December 2023","Ocean Flower Island, Hainan","198474","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190293831"

This paper considers approximately 0.2 million listings of Airbnb units across seven European cities, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Brussels, Geneva, Istanbul, London, and Milan, after the COVID-19 pandemic for predictive analysis. RoBERTa, a transfer learning framework in conjunction with K-means-based unsupervised text clustering, was used to form a homogeneous grouping of Airbnb units across the cities. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) driven advanced ensemble machine learning frameworks have been utilized for predicting rental prices across the formed clusters of respective cities using 32 offer-related features. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging field of AI, has been utilized to interpret the high-end predictive modeling to infer deeper insights into the nature and direction of influence of explanatory features on rental prices at respective locations. The rental prices of Airbnb units in Geneva and Brussels have appeared to be highly predictable, while the units in London and Milan have been found to be less predictable.

The comparative impact of everolimus (EVR)-based regimens versus standard of care (mycophenolic acid+standard calcineurin inhibitor [MPA+sCNI]) on cardiovascular outcomes in de novo kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is poorly understood. The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in KTRs receiving EVR+reduced CNI (rCNI) or MPA+sCNI from the TRANSplant eFficacy and safety Outcomes with an eveRolimus-based regiMen study was evaluated. Methods. The incidence of MACE was determined for all randomized patients receiving at least 1 dose of the study drug. Factors associated with MACEs were determined by logistic regression. Risk of MACE out to 3 y post-study was calculated using the Patient Outcome in Renal Transplantation equation. Results. MACE occurred in 81 of 1014 (8.0%; EVR+rCNI) versus 89 of 1012 (8.8%; MPA+sCNI) KTRs (risk ratio, 0.91 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.21]). The incidence of circulatory death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, or angina was similar between the arms. Incidence of MACE was similar between EVR+rCNI and MPA+sCNI arms with a higher incidence in prespecified risk groups: older age, pretransplant diabetes (15.1% versus 15.9%), statin use (8.5% versus 10.8%), and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (Month 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 versus >60 mL/min/1.73 m2; odds ratio, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.02-4.86]; P = 0.044), respectively. Predicted risk of MACE within 3 y of follow-up did not differ between the treatment arms. Conclusions. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were similar between de novo KTRs receiving EVR+rCNI and MPA+sCNI. EVR+rCNI is a viable alternative to the current standard of care in KTRs. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Predicting readmission helps to reduce such risks by avoiding early discharge, providing appropriate intervention, and planning for patient placement after ICU discharge. Unfortunately, ICU scores such as the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health (APACHE) could help predict mortality or evaluate illness severity. Still, it is ineffective in predicting ICU readmission. This study introduces a clinical monitoring fog-computing-based system for remote prognosis and monitoring of intensive care patients. This proposed monitoring system uses the advantages of machine learning (ML) approaches for generating a real-time alert signal to doctors for supplying e-healthcare, accelerating decision-making, and monitoring and controlling health systems. The proposed system includes three main layers. First, the data acquisition layer, in which we collect the vital signs and lab tests of the patient's health conditions in real-time. Then, the fog computing layer processes. The results are then sent to the cloud layer, which offers sizable storage space for patient healthcare. Demographic data, lab tests, and vital signs are aggregated from the MIMIC III dataset for 10,465 patients. Feature selection methods: Genetic algorithm (GA) and practical swarm optimization (PSO) are used to choose the optimal feature subset from detests. Moreover, Different traditional ML models, ensemble learning models, and the proposed stacking models are applied to full features and selected features to predict readmission after 30 days of ICU discharge. The proposed stacking models recorded the highest performance compared to other models. The proposed stacking ensemble model with selected features by POS achieved promising results (accuracy = 98.42, precision = 98.42, recall = 98.42, and F1-Score = 98.42), compared to full features and selected features. We also, provide model explanations to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and trust in the developed model through local and global explanations.  © 2013 IEEE.","ensemble learning; explainable artificial intelligence; ICU readmission rate; Machine learning; stacking ensemble learning","Data acquisition; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Edge computing; Feature Selection; Fog computing; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Learning systems; Medical information systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Physiology; Swarm intelligence; Admittance measurements; Edge computing; Ensemble learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; ICU readmission rate; Machine-learning; MIMIC; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Predictive models; Real - Time system; Stacking ensemble learning; Stackings; Swarm optimization; Real time systems","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171584043"

Student dropout is a complex phenomenon influenced by diverse factors, including internal and external, student characteristics and skills. To enhance retention strategies, it is crucial to identify the nuanced reasons behind dropout decisions, which often go unnoticed by university staff. Therefore, this study investigates the integration of metaheuristic optimization techniques with Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning (ML) models for student dropout identification. By leveraging these well-known ML techniques, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of dropout predictions in terms of standard classification metrics. Further, by harnessing the exploration and exploitation capabilities of metaheuristics, the study aims to fine-tune both models, thereby increasing their accuracy and robustness in identifying at-risk students. Additionally, to address limitations of existing metaheuristics, a modified version of recently proposed Sinh Cosh Optimizer (SCHO) was developed, that manages to generate well-performing XGBoost and AdaBoost models for students dropout prediction. The study demonstrates that both tuned models can effectively identify at-risk students, providing valuable insights for targeted educational support initiatives. Three experimental evaluations, two with binary and one with multi-class student dropout classification, are conducted on real-world datasets along with rigid comparative analysis and statistical validation with other cutting-edge metaheuristics. According to experimental outcomes, proposed methodology outscores significantly other approaches in terms of performance. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of influential factors was performed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Shapley Additive Global importancE (SAGE) explainable AI techniques on the best generated models to identify the factors that most significantly influence dropout decisions. This work contributes to advancing AI applications in higher education, providing insights for policymakers and institutions to design targeted interventions for student retention, ultimately enhancing the overall success and effectiveness of higher education systems.  © 2024 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose a model based on Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for multi-track music generation. This model incorporates self-attention and introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism in the generator to enhance its expressive capability. Additionally, we transpose all music to C major in training to ensure data consistency and quality.

In this study, we first aimed to assess whether there would be differences in terms of specific neuropsychological variables (e.g., IQ, working memory, executive functioning, and emotion decoding) between different groups of IPV perpetrators, affected or not by ADHD, and also compared with non-violent men (without ADHD). Second, we evaluated differences in dropout and recidivism among the subgroups of IPV perpetrators. Third, we assessed whether ADHD interacts with neuropsychological functioning to explain treatment compliance (dropout) and official recidivism among IPV perpetrators. Method: We administered a set of neuropsychological tests and self-reports to a group of IPV perpetrators with ADHD (n = 161), without ADHD (n = 163), and non-violent men (n = 103). Data on IPV perpetrators’ treatment compliance and official recidivism were collected after treatment. Results: Our results indicated that all the groups of IPV perpetrators presented worse performance in all cognitive domains than controls. Furthermore, ADHD IPV perpetrators also showed worse performance in all cognitive domains than IPV perpetrators without ADHD, except for emotion decoding abilities. Most importantly, the combined subtype of ADHD IPV perpetrators presented the highest rate of dropout and official recidivism. Lastly, ADHD diagnosis and neuropsychological impairments separately offered a considerable explanation of treatment compliance and recidivism but their combination did not increase the amount of explained variance. Conclusions: Our study highlights the need to implement good screening processes for correctly diagnosing IPV perpetrators and, consequently, designing more effective intervention programs © 2023 Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Madrid.

Methods: In post hoc analysis, major endpoints were 48-week and 96-week weight and body mass index (BMI) changes. Factors associated with weight/BMI changes within the first 48 weeks of DTG exposure, proportion of participants by category of percentage weight change, proportions of BMI categories over time, and impact on metabolic outcomes were also assessed. Results: Between May 2014 and November 2015, 204 (DTG-I) and 208 (DTG-D) participants were included. Weight significantly increased (mean, +0.810 kg DTG-I arm, and +0.979 kg DTG-D arm) in the first 48 weeks postswitch, but remained stable from 48 to 96 weeks in DTG-I arm. Switching from darunavir, White race, total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio <3.7, and normal/underweight BMI were independently associated with higher weight/BMI gains. The proportion of participants with ≥5% weight change increased similarly in both arms over time. The proportions of BMI categories, use of lipid-lowering drugs, diabetes and/or use of antidiabetic agents, and hypertension and/or use of antihypertensive agents did not change within or between arms at 48 and 96 weeks. Conclusions: Switching from protease inhibitors to dolutegravir in persons with HIV with high cardiovascular risk led to modest weight gain limited to the first 48 weeks, which involved preferentially normal-weight or underweight persons and was not associated with negative metabolic outcomes.

This involves converting the complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs in the network into a set of interpretable rules. The main objective of rule extraction is to enhance the interpretability of decision-making in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and make it more understandable for human experts, especially in critical domains like healthcare, where clear decision-making is essential. Despite the ability of machine learning methods to interpret ANNs, interpreting complex neural networks remains limited, as most studies tend to sacrifice one criterion, related to rule quality, in favor of another. Rule extraction methods applied directly to complex neural networks may produce overly specific rules that are tailored to the training data. Such rules can suffer from overfitting and may not generalize well to unseen data. Also, The use of multiobjective genetic algorithms for rule extraction can result in a large number of rules, making it challenging for decision-makers to interpret them. This study proposes an innovative approach to address challenges in rule extraction from complex artificial neural networks (ANNs) by integrating a multiobjective genetic algorithm with the PROMETHEE method. By integrating these techniques, the study aims to identify meaningful relationships between inputs and outputs of ANNs, generating concise and reliable rules that are ranked based on support, confidence, and lift values. The use of PROMETHEE's rule ranking mechanism enabled the consideration of rule priority during candidate selection, guiding the genetic algorithm towards discovering high-quality rule sets and efficiently exploring the search space. This approach not only enhances the quality of extracted rules but also facilitates efficient decision-making by striking a balance between rule accuracy, fidelity, and comprehensibility, thus contributing to advancing the understanding of complex neural networks. By equally weighting the criteria (support, confidence, and lift) during the rule ranking mechanism, our approach achieved high coverage rates ranging from 94.88 % to 100 % and generated a manageable number of rules that could be easily interpreted by human experts, ranging from 5 to 10.5. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to significantly improve decision-making accuracy and interpretability across various real-world applications, making it a promising tool for applications in healthcare, finance, and other fields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Classification rules; Multiobjective genetic algorithm; PROMETHEE method","Complex networks; Decision making; Extraction; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Learning systems; Classification rules; Complex neural networks; Decisions makings; Human expert; Input and outputs; Interpretability; Multi-objectives genetic algorithms; PROMETHEE; PROMETHEE method; Rules extraction; Neural networks","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181004838"

Spark is used as a parallel processing model for the effective processing of large-scale data, PSO is integrated to improve the quality of the intrusion detection system by avoiding sensitive initialization and premature convergence of the clustering algorithm and finally, XAI techniques are used to enhance interpretability and explainability of intrusion recommendations by providing both micro and macro explanations of detected intrusions.

The computational methods can be used to accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation sites. In this paper, a new prediction model of SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation sites, called DE-MHAIPs, is proposed. First, we use six feature extraction methods to extract protein sequence information from different perspectives. For the first time, we use a differential evolution (DE) algorithm to learn individual feature weights and fuse multi-information in a weighted combination. Next, Group LASSO is used to select a subset of good features. Then, the important protein information is given higher weight through multi-head attention. After that, the processed data is fed into long short-term memory network (LSTM) to further enhance model's ability to learn features. Finally, the data from LSTM are input into fully connected neural network (FCN) to predict SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation sites. The AUC values of the S/T and Y datasets under 5-fold cross-validation reach 91.98% and 98.32%, respectively. The AUC values of the two datasets on the independent test set reach 91.72% and 97.78%, respectively. The experimental results show that the DE-MHAIPs method exhibits excellent predictive ability compared with other methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Differential evolution algorithm; Group LASSO; Multi-head attention mechanism; Multi-view feature fusion; SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation sites","Algorithms; COVID-19; Humans; Learning; Phosphorylation; SARS-CoV-2; Diseases; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Long short-term memory; Optimization; Phosphorylation; Proteins; Regression analysis; Attention mechanisms; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Features fusions; Group LASSO; Multi-head attention mechanism; Multi-view feature fusion; Multi-views; Phosphorylation sites; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 phosphorylation site; amino acid sequence; article; attention; cross validation; differential evolution algorithm; feature extraction; human; learning; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; long short term memory network; nonhuman; prediction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; algorithm; coronavirus disease 2019; learning; phosphorylation; Coronavirus","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153676827"

In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency.

Despite numerous successful applications, several studies have shown that the NSGA-II is less effective for larger numbers of objectives. In this work, we use mathematical runtime analyses to rigorously demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon. We show that even on the simple $m$ -objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in subexponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently. This is not a problem for two objectives, where any sorting of a pairwise incomparable set of solutions according to one objective is also such a sorting according to the other objective (in the inverse order). © 2023 The Authors.

The partnership between biomedical scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) specialists has resulted in the creation of several computational tools for the preliminary assessment of antiviral drugs. One such category of drugs comprises antiviral peptides (AVPs) that are part of an organism's initial immune response to viral invasion and infection. The models developed to identify AVPs do not offer any insight into the characteristics that significantly contribute to their antiviral nature. So, a domain expert needs a thorough analysis to choose the most potent AVPs among the ones found by such models in antiviral proteins before going for synthesis. This work aims to accelerate this process by proposing a fully automated in silico framework that identifies AVPs in antiviral protein chains and optimizes them based on some desirable characteristics identified by analyzing the existing AVPs through an explainable machine learning model. This model has been built using extreme gradient boosting and has an accuracy of 90%, which is better than the existing classifiers. The two characteristics found by this explainable model conflict with each other's optimization; hence, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms are used to find the pareto-optimal AVPs by establishing a trade-off between them. To evaluate the efficacy of the suggested framework, we found and optimized the AVPs present in some well-known antiviral proteins. The pareto-optimal AVPs were identified and proposed for synthesis and validation of antiviral activity.

In addition to these, we examine an array of models, including XGBoost, Decision Trees (DT), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Linear Regression (LR). Among them, XGBoost has the best performance in every category. We use the Bayesian optimization method for hyperparameter fine-tuning to improve forecast accuracy. Our in-depth examination demonstrates the better predictive skills of ensemble models like RF and XGBoost over LR, which is limited in capturing data complexity beyond linear relationships. With an R2 of 0.952, RMSE of 4.88, MAE of 3.24, and MAPE of 9.94%, XGBoost performs noticeably better than its rivals. Using SHAP analysis, we determine that curing age, water content and cement concentration are the main factors influencing the model’s predictive capacity, with the contributions of superplasticizer and fly ash being minimal. Curing age and cement content have an interesting positive association with CS, but water content has a negative link with CS. These results highlight the value of machine learning, especially the effectiveness of XGBoost, as a potent device for forecasting the CS of mixed concrete. Additionally, the knowledge gained from our research provides designers and researchers in concrete materials with useful direction, highlighting the most important factors for compressive strength. Future studies should work toward additional optimization by attempting to verify these models across a wider variety of concrete compositions and test settings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blended concrete; Compressive strength; Explainable machine learning; Game theory; Machine learning; Shapley additive explanations; XGBoost","","","Institute for Ionics","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163280764"

One of the most debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus is the diabetic foot (DF), resulting in an increased risk of hospitalization and significant morbidity and mortality. Amputation above or below the knee is a feared complication and the mortality in these patients is higher than for most forms of cancer. Identifying and interpreting relationships existing among the factors involved in DF diagnosis is still challenging. Although machine learning approaches have proven to achieve great accuracy in DF prediction, few advances have been performed in understanding how they make such predictions, resulting in mistrust of their use in real contexts. In this study, we present an approach based on Genetic Programming to build a simple global explainable classifier, named X-GPC, which, unlike existing tools such as LIME and SHAP, provides a global interpretation of the DFU diagnosis through a mathematical model. Also, an easy consultable 3d graph is provided, which could be used by the medical staff to figure out the patients’ situation and take decisions for patients’ healing. Experimental results obtained by using a real-world dataset have shown the ability of the proposal to diagnose DF with an accuracy of 100% outperforming other techniques of the state-of-the-art. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Diabetic Foot; Explainability; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); Genetic programming (GP); Interpretability; Machine Learning; Symbolic regression (SR)","Diagnosis; Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Lime; Machine learning; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic foot; Explainability; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Genetic programming; Interpretability; Machine-learning; Multiple biomarkers; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141235542"

The research was carried out with 180 students. The number of samples was determined by power analysis (a=0.05,b=0.20, effect size=0.25). Participants were pre-screened and divided into 4 groups with the closest group mean (group 1: control group: the group that did not take anatomy lessons, group 2: video-assisted anatomy education, group 3: 3D anatomy course, group 4: classical anatomy education group). The courses in the training groups were organised as 4 hours/day, 2 days/week for 5 weeks. At the end of the course, the students were re-examined and scaled to determine the difference in scores and self-efficacy between the groups.

Genetic programming hyper-heuristic has been successfully applied to automatically evolve effective dispatching rules to make a schedule in real time without much domain knowledge. However, the interpretability of GP-evolved rules has been largely neglected, which could lead to the lack of reliability and trustworthiness of the evolved rules in practice. Current work related to interpretable genetic programming algorithms primarily uses the model size as the interpretability metric. This could not fully reflect the interpretability of evolved rules. To overcome the limitation, we employ structural complexity and dimension gap as more comprehensive interpretability measures. In addition, a new multi-objective genetic programming algorithm, which applies the a non-dominated sorting method to solve the objective selection bias issue, is proposed to optimise the makespan (scheduling objective), structural complexity and dimension gap simultaneously. A variety of experiments demonstrates the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm based on effectiveness, convergence and diversity. Furthermore, the semantics of evolved dispatching rules are analysed to show their better interpretability.  © 2024 IEEE.","flexible job shop scheduling; interpretability; multi-objective genetic programming","Heuristic programming; Job shop scheduling; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling algorithms; Dispatching rules; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Genetic programming algorithms; Hyper-heuristics; Interpretability; Multi objective; Multi-objective genetic programming; Scheduling rules; Structural complexity; Structural dimensions; Genetic programming","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","ASK Corporation; et al.; IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society; International Neural Network Society; Science Council of Japan","13th IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2024","30 June 2024 through 5 July 2024","Yokohama","201580","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201734268"

To accurately calculate winter wheat ETc with limited meteorological data, the present study proposed two interpretable machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) as well as non-interpretable ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN)) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using observed winter wheat ETc data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at Luan Cheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to assess the performance of models. This demonstrated that the ML models based on the crop coefficient (Kc) and solar radiation (Rn) were accurate and offered a workaround for calculating winter wheat ETc in the absence of meteorological data. In four ML models, the ninth input combination, consisting of Kc, Rn, daily air maximum temperature (Tmax), daily air minimum temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (n), and wind speed with a height of 2 m (U2), produced the best estimate of ETc. Among them, the PSO-based SVM (PSO-SVM) model obtained the best results for estimating ETc with MAE, RMSE, NSE, R2, and GPI values of 0.389 mm·d−1, 0.562 mm·d−1 0.910, 0.911, and 0.975, respectively, showing the advantages of the non-interpretable ML model in ETc forecasting. Accurate descriptions of actual hydrological and climatic processes were given by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The inflection points of daily climatic parameters (Tmin, Tmax, Rn, n) related to ETc were determined to be 3.80 °C, 5.50 °C, 1.62 MJ·m−2·d−1, 1.37 h, respectively. This work has potential to overcome the difficulty of measuring winter wheat ETc properly due to the lack of meteorological data and accomplish appropriate water management to conserve water and increase water productivity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Crop evapotranspiration; Interpretability; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Winter wheat","Deep neural networks; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Learning systems; Lime; Mean square error; Meteorology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Swarm intelligence; Water supply; Wind; Crop evapotranspiration; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mean absolute error; Meteorological data; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Swarm optimization; Winter wheat; algorithm; evapotranspiration; exploration; machine learning; numerical model; water use efficiency; wheat; winter; Efficiency","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168008233"

This runs counter to the traditional interpretations of De Caelo I.2, which consider how, and how completely, Aristotle uses the differentiation of simple magnitudes to differentiate simple bodies, and which assume that he introduces the notion of a simple body independently of the notion of a simple motion. But the traditional interpretations miss the point of Aristotle’s argument in De Caelo I.2, which – so I argue – is to introduce the notion of simple motions, using this to introduce the notion of simple bodies, and to thereby provide an explanatory account of all possible locomotion. This is the reason why Aristotle identifies simple bodies in De Caelo I.2 with the fundamental components of the universe. © Jiayu Zhang, 2024.","Aristotle; De Caelo; explanation; locomotion; nature; simple body; simple motion","","","Brill Academic Publishers","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194367146"

Methodology/approach: Using analysis of variance and linear regression tests, we conducted data analysis on both direct relationships and mediations with a sample consisting of 217 university students. Main results: We identified that the need for safety positively influences entrepreneurial motivation. We also recognized that this result occurs through the double sequential mediation of entrepreneurial motivation and regulatory focus. Thus, students with a promotional regulatory focus were more willing to undertake than those whose regulatory focus is on prevention. Theoretical/methodological contributions: Higgins and Pinelli (2020) indicated that entrepreneurship rarely uses regulatory focus theory despite it being adequate. Furthermore, the economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic may be a factor that influences the motivation to undertake, as it is an extrinsic motivation driven by the need for security. Relevance/originality: We identified that the need for security can trigger the motivation to undertake, making individuals present a state of promotional self-regulation. Social/management contributions: Based on the results, it can be stated that entrepreneurial education should address different types of communication in order to encourage future entrepreneurs. Clarification of the gain is commonly applied in classrooms, but no-loss communication should also be adopted. © ANEGEPE, São Paulo-SP.

The qualitative part (Phase 1) is an interview study of 19 kindergarten teachers in two focus groups, aiming to develop a conceptual structure of teachers’ behavioural, normative and control beliefs. The quantitative part (Phase 2) is a survey study of 243 teachers from the randomly sampled 21 kindergartens regarding their EVAE beliefs and practices. Most teachers believe in child-centred teaching while practising teacher-directed instruction and support creativity while delivering closed-ended instruction. Four influential factors are identified to account for this gap: (1) practising child-centred pedagogies as a result of behavioural beliefs; (2) undervaluing visual arts as a result of normative beliefs; (3) instructing children directly as a result of normative beliefs; and (4) delivering subject knowledge in studio teaching as a result of control beliefs. These findings imply that Hong Kong kindergarten teachers struggle between two approaches and suffer from a lack of support from educational authorities and society. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate practices for visual arts education in Hong Kong kindergartens. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, more studies are needed to understand the characteristics of MR and the relation with texts written by students in disciplinary genres. This study analyzes the relation between MR and the quality of scientific explanations written by 359 4th grade elementary students in two didactic units. We characterized RM performances in five dimensions (discursive, textual, grammatical, lexical-semantic, conceptual). Regression models showed that performance in RM predicts the quality of explanations, with a different contribution per dimension and didactic unit. In addition, performance in the conceptual dimension for unit 1 significantly predicted the quality of explanations for unit 2. Our study shows that MR is a variable associated with textual construction that we recommend enhancing in future instructional proposals. © (2024), (Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo).

To measure fiscal de/centralization, the study constructs original data sets based on reports from various organizations over multiple years. The analysis results demonstrate that fiscal de/centralization varies temporally and spatially. While improved capacity is associated with enhanced own-source revenue, the desire to improve regional fiscal management often results in fiscal centralization. Further, although Ethiopian regions have constitutional powers to determine the bases and rates of regional taxes, the central government has significant influence in such matters, often manipulating regional affairs in disregard of the constitution. The article reveals substantial variations of own-source revenues across regions attributed to regional differences in capacity, development, location, and investment distribution. The article highlights the importance of a systematic understanding of region-specific challenges to accurately assess the effectiveness of decentralization policies in the global South.

Although the evolved routing policies are highly effective, they are typically very large and complex, and hard to be understood and trusted by real users. Existing studies have attempted to improve the interpretability by developing new GP approaches to evolve both effective and interpretable (e.g., with smaller program size) routing policies. However, they still have limitations due to the tradeoff between effectiveness and interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a new post-hoc explanation approach to explaining the effective but complex routing policies evolved by GP. The new approach includes a local ranking explanation and a global explanation module. The local ranking explanation uses particle swarm optimization to learn an interpretable linear model that accurately explains the local behavior of the routing policy for each decision situation. Then, the global explanation module uses a clustering technique to summarize the local explanations into a global explanation. The experimental results and case studies on the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can obtain accurate and understandable explanations of the routing policies evolved for uncertain arc routing problems. Our explanation approach is not restricted to uncertain arc routing, but has a great potential to be generalized to other optimization and machine learning problems, such as learning classifier systems and reinforcement learning. © 2023 IEEE.","Capacitated arc routing; genetic programming (GP); hyper-heuristic; interpretability","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Job analysis; Network routing; Particle size analysis; Reinforcement learning; Arc routing; Arc routing problems; Capacitated arc routing; Computational modelling; Hyper-heuristics; Interpretability; Routing policies; Routings; Task analysis; Vehicle's dynamics; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147265828"

This transparency enhances user trust, facilitates accountability, and enables a better understanding of AI systems decisions, especially in critical applications where insights into decision processes are essential. These benefits have increased XAI research interest, aiming to provide techniques for interpreting and understanding the behavior of intelligent models. Counterfactual explanation is a popular technique for model interpretation based on updating a few features such that the outcome of an AI model is changed. Users can gain insights into the critical features or factors influencing the AI system's decision by analyzing these counterfactuals. However, most counterfactual techniques require more qualifications, such as simplicity, robustness, and coherence. In this research, we propose a novel approach, Adaptive Feature Weight Genetic Explanation (AFWGE), for generating counterfactual explanations of AI models, where a custom genetic algorithm (GA) is employed, incorporating adaptive feature weights to enhance the algorithm's performance. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AFWGE allows for the adaptation of feature weights during the evolutionary process, producing more effective counterfactual explanations with superior proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and actionability. Furthermore, it emphasizes feature weights as reliable indicators of the significance of the model's features, providing valuable insights for interpreting the model. AFWGE not only advances the field of counterfactual explanation generation but also establishes a robust framework for assessing feature importance in machine learning models.  © 2023 IEEE.","artificial neural network; counterfactual explanation; Explainable artificial intelligence; genetic algorithm; machine learning","Decision making; Embedded systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Transparency; Adaptation models; Closed box; Counterfactual explanation; Counterfactuals; Decisions makings; Explainable AI; Explainable artificial intelligence; Feature weight; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Genetic algorithms","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194095880"

Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for machine learning. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly considered in GP until recently, following the surge in the popularity of XAI. This article provides a comprehensive review of the studies on GP that can potentially improve the model interpretability, both explicitly and implicitly, as a byproduct. We group the existing studies related to explainable artificial intelligence by GP into two categories. The first category considers the intrinsic interpretability, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP. The second category focuses on post-hoc interpretability, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models, or explain the models evolved by GP by simpler models such as linear models. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the strong potential of GP for improving the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing the complex tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Genetic programming (GP)","Balancing; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Machine components; Machine learning; Applications domains; Black boxes; Critical applications; Interpretability; Linear modeling; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Simple modeling; Standard machines; Genetic programming","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144061364"

This paper proposes an image dehazing network based on multi-scale lifting and attention mechanism fusion U-Net structure. Firstly, the downsampling operation is used to obtain multi-scale feature maps, and the feature maps of the encoder and decoder are connected by jump connection to realize feature fusion. The purpose is to transfer and fuse information between feature maps of different scales to improve the performance of the model. At the same time, in order to better aggregate cross-window information, an overlapping cross-attention module is introduced to enhance the information complementarity of adjacent window functions. By comparing the proposed algorithm with the other five algorithms in the public datasets Reside and NTIRE, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in defogging effect and color retention. Specifically, the average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the proposed algorithm reaches 27.5 dB, and the average structure similarity (SSIM) is 0.9573. Compared with the other five algorithms, the performance has been significantly improved. Compared with the best comparison algorithm, the PSNR of the proposed algorithm is improved by 2.17 dB, and the SSIM is improved by 0.0063.

Based on mixed integer programming, existing methods rely on branch-and-bound aided algorithms and can struggle to achieve satisfactory computational time performance. In order to avoid the computational burden of branch-and-bound, this work introduces the Column-Generation-based Genetic Algorithm (CGbGA) as a heuristic approach to the ONTS problem. The method, based on branch-and-price principles, combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem of interest efficiently. We generate solution vectors for each job using DP and adapt mutation and crossover operators to work on a column-wide scale. This ensures that every solution is valid for the given job. Also, a novel pseudo-shadow pricing strategy is employed to mimic the pricing procedure of the branch-and-price algorithm. To better understand the impact of the number of available columns on the incumbent solution, we employ Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Our results, based on a set of representative literature instances, demonstrate the potential of CGbGA in terms of solution value and computational solving time compared to commercially available solvers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic Algorithm; Nanosatellite; Quality of Service; Scheduling","Costs; Dynamic programming; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Lime; Multiobjective optimization; Multitasking; Orbits; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Branch and bounds; Column generation; Energy aware; Knapsacks; Nanosatellite; Offline; Quality-of-service; Scheduling; Task scheduling problem; Tasks scheduling; Genetic algorithms","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162182764"

Utilising a theoretical economic model, the study delves into the persistence of these extractive practices and their eventual transformation into more inclusive, market-driven systems. By charting Diamang’s historical trajectory, the paper explores how this deeply entrenched system transitioned from coercive labour to a free-market system, catalysed by significant socio-political changes such as the abrupt independence of neighbouring countries, domestic unrest and international pressures. The model provides new insights into the historical dominance of coercive labour institutions and reveals how external shocks can precipitate rapid institutional change. Ultimately, this study enhances our understanding of colonial labour market dynamics and highlights the evolving nature of extractive practices within economic history, with specific reference to the understudied case of the Portuguese colonial empire. © 2024, Department of Economic History and Institutions, Policy and World Economy.

The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.. ©2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Electronic health record; Computer-based system; Data governances; De-identification; Digitisation; Discharge summary; Financial impacts; Healthcare organizations; Language model; Patient discharge; Personal information","Demner-Fushman D.; Ananiadou S.; Miwa M.; Roberts K.; Tsujii J.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (SIGBIOMED)","23rd Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Biomedical Natural Language Processing, BioNLP 2024","16 August 2024","Bangkok","202280","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204503249"

Design: Deep learning model development. Participants: Three hundred eleven participants from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SD-OCT Study. Methods: A dataset of 1284 SD-OCT scans from 311 participants was used to develop Deep-GA-Net. Cross-validation was used to evaluate Deep-GA-Net, where each testing set contained no participant from the corresponding training set. En face heatmaps and important regions at the B-scan level were used to visualize the outputs of Deep-GA-Net, and 3 ophthalmologists graded the presence or absence of GA in them to assess the explainability (i.e., understandability and interpretability) of its detections. Main Outcome Measures: Accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under precision-recall curve (APR). Results: Compared with other networks, Deep-GA-Net achieved the best metrics, with accuracy of 0.93, AUC of 0.94, and APR of 0.91, and received the best gradings of 0.98 and 0.68 on the en face heatmap and B-scan grading tasks, respectively. Conclusions: Deep-GA-Net was able to detect GA accurately from SD-OCT scans. The visualizations of Deep-GA-Net were more explainable, as suggested by 3 ophthalmologists.

Explaining this psychological phenomenon could help to reduce side-effect experience, however, it is yet to be explored if this can be applied to clinical settings where new medication is prescribed. In addition, the degree to which a health-care provider empathetically communicates this to patients may have an impact. To investigate this, we carried out 2 × 2 factorial trial to assess the effect of nocebo explanation and empathy (plus their interaction) on side-effect expectations following a fictional GP consultation prescribing a new medication. Overall, 208 participants were randomised to watch one of the four fictive GP consultations and play the role of the patient. In all videos, participants received information about the reason for the consultation, the recommendation of a new fictive medicine, how to take it, benefits and side-effects. The videos differed in whether the GP provided an explanation of the nocebo effect (yes/no) and whether they communicated in an empathetic style (yes/no). After watching the video, participants were asked about their side-effect expectations and rated the quality of the GP’s communication. Two-way ANOVAs revealed no main effect of nocebo explanation on expectation of side-effects warned or not warned about in the consultation. However, there was a main effect of empathy, with participants watching the empathetic consultations having significantly lower expectations of non-warned-about side-effects. There was no significant interaction. Findings suggest that explaining the nocebo effect and GP empathy did little to allay expectations of side-effects that were specifically mentioned in the consultation. However, GP empathy had an effect by helping to reduce additional side-effect expectations participants still had. Future work should extend these findings to real GP consultations where the full dimensions of empathy can be explored. © 2023 The Author(s).

We discuss the advancements in simulation-based training, AI-driven assessment tools, video-based assessment systems, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, and the potential role of LLMs in the transcription, translation, and summarization of feedback. Despite the promising opportunities presented by AI integration, several challenges must be addressed, including accuracy and reliability, ethical and privacy concerns, bias in AI models, integration with existing training systems, and training and adoption of AI-assisted tools.

Leveraging eight pivotal input features—building compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution—we elucidate the intricate relationships between building characteristics and their corresponding heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL). We meticulously analyze these features across 12 diverse structural forms, each emblematic of unique architectural designs and building materials. Using a dataset encompassing 768 buildings, we demonstrate the prowess of our proposed models. Among the algorithms we employed, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm stands out, registering impressive accuracy metrics (HL: RSQ = 0.9986, RMSE = 0.3797, MAE = 0.2467 and MAPE = 1.1812; CL: RSQ = 0.9938, RMSE = 0.7578, MAE = 0.4546 and MAPE = 1.6365). We further integrate SHAP analysis, revealing that relative compactness positively influences both HL and CL the most, closely followed by surface area and glazing area. By merging an explainable extreme gradient boosting algorithm with a Bayesian-based metaheuristic optimization technique, we ensure both high predictive accuracy and interpretability. This study holds profound implications for enhancing building energy efficiency, curbing waste, and championing the shift to sustainable energy sources, aligning seamlessly with SDG 7. © 2023 The Authors","Building energy performance; Explainable ML; Heating and cooling loads; Metaheuristic Bayesian optimization; ML algorithms; SHAP analysis","Energy efficiency; Glazes; Optimization; Bayesian optimization; Building energy performance; Cooling load; Explainable ML; Heating and cooling loads; Heating load; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic bayesian optimization; ML algorithm; SHAP analyse; Buildings","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177171405"

Lifestyle, genetics, nutrition, and stress are all significant contributors to rising mortality rates. CAD is preventable through early intervention and lifestyle changes. As a result, low-cost automated solutions are required to detect CAD early and help healthcare professionals treat chronic diseases efficiently. Machine learning applications in medicine have increased due to their ability to detect data patterns. Employing machine learning to classify the occurrence of coronary artery disease could assist doctors in reducing misinterpretation. The research project entails the creation of a coronary artery disease diagnosis system based on machine learning. Using patient medical records, we demonstrate how machine learning can help identify if an individual will acquire coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the study highlights the most critical risk factors for coronary artery disease. We used two machine learning approaches, Catboost and LightGBM classifiers, to predict the patient with coronary artery disease. We employed various data augmentation methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), to solve the imbalanced data problem. Optuna was applied to optimize hyperparameters. The proposed method was tested on the real-world dataset Z-Alizadeh Sani. The acquired findings were satisfactory, as the model could predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a particular individual by combining Catboost with VAE, which demonstrated good accuracy compared to the other approaches.

Genetic programming (GP) has been widely used to learn scheduling heuristics for DFJSS automatically. Ideally, we prefer to have effective and small scheduling heuristics which tend to be easy to be interpreted. However, the effectiveness and the sizes of scheduling heuristics are conflicting, and reducing the rule sizes tends to worsen the effectiveness of scheduling heuristics. This is a typical multi-objective optimisation problem. However, the existing studies in multi-objective DFJSS consider the effectiveness-related objectives only such as minimising max-flowtime and mean-flowtime rather than interpretability-related objectives such as rule size. To fill this gap, this paper aims to propose an interpretability-aware multi-objective GP to learn a well-distributed Pareto-front of scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. This paper first adopts a multi-objective GP algorithm with α-dominance and archive from a routing problem to DFJSS. Then, we propose to use traditional dominance relation based Pareto front for α and archive updating and an objective normalisation based α-dominance sorting strategy to further improve the performance of the adopted multi-objective GP. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-objective GP algorithms in different DFJSS scenarios. © 2023 IEEE.","Job shop scheduling; Multi-objective genetic programming; Scheduling heuristics learning; α-dominance","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Multiobjective optimization; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Heuristic learning; Interpretability; Job-Shop scheduling; Learn+; Multi objective; Multi-objective genetic programming; Scheduling heuristic learning; Scheduling heuristics; Α-dominance; Job shop scheduling","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2023","1 July 2023 through 5 July 2023","Chicago","192935","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174525423"

This paper investigates a novel method of explanatory feature extraction based on analysis of the search trajectory and compares the results to those of sensitivity analysis using “Weighted Ranked Biased Overlap”. We apply these techniques to search trajectories generated by a genetic algorithm as it solves a staff rostering problem. We show that there is a significant overlap between these two explainability methods when identifying subsets of rostered workers whose allocations are responsible for large portions of fitness change in an optimization run. Both methods identify similar patterns in sensitivity, but our method also draws out additional information. As the search progresses, the techniques reveal how individual workers increase or decrease in the influence on the overall rostering solution’s quality. Our method also helps identify workers with a lower impact on overall solution fitness and at what stage in the search these individuals can be considered highly flexible in their roster assignment. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Algorithm Trajectories; Evolutionary Algorithms; Explainable AI (XAI); Principal Component Analysis; Sensitivity Analysis","Genetic algorithms; Principal component analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Algorithm trajectory; Critical applications; End-users; Explainable AI (XAI); Metaheuristic; Principal-component analysis; Solution quality; Staff Rostering; Trajectory analysis; Workers'; Trajectories","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2023 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2023 Companion","15 July 2023 through 19 July 2023","Lisbon","191255","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169044310"

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) plays a vital role, primarily through testing, which can be carried out manually or automatically. Yet, creating comprehensive test data (TD) for web applications can be a formidable task. Manual test data generation (TDG) is time-consuming and error prone. Automation of TDG has become increasingly important in the realm of software quality assurance as it enables efficient and effective testing of software systems. The need for an appropriate framework for automated TDG is critical to achieve comprehensive and reliable test coverage. Automated TDG offers significant advantages, including time and resource savings, improved test coverage, and seamless integration into the software development process. The core aim of this research is to bridge the gap between manual and existing automated methods, resulting in time and cost savings, heightened testing efficiency, and elevated software quality. Research objectives encompass comparing the adaptability of an AGA based automated TDG model and a LLM based automated TDG model to a web application. The results from the LLM model for triangle classification program was found to be potentially acceptable and accurate than the AGA model’s results. This research discusses the challenges encountered when implementing and using the AGA-based framework in the web application context and how an LLM model could overcome the challenges. The study highlights the benefits of using the LLM approach, demonstrating its relevance and accuracy in generating test data compared to the Genetic Algorithm-based model. The practical implications for software quality assurance practices are discussed, emphasizing the enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM model in improving software quality. © 2024 IEEE.","Adaptive Genetic Algorithm; Automated test data generation; Large Language Model; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Test automation","Application programs; Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data accuracy; Software design; Software quality; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Automated test data generation; Language model; Large language model; Retrieval augmented generation; Software Quality; Software quality assurance; Test Automation; WEB application; Web applications; Software testing","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Conference on Data, Decision and Systems, ICDDS 2024","5 December 2024 through 7 December 2024","Bangalore","207540","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001577708"

In recent years, deep learning methods have demonstrated superior prediction outcomes compared to conventional numerical models. However, due to limited observational data, most of these deep learning methods learn information from simulation data derived from physical models, and ensuring the quality of such simulation data can prove challenging. As a result, the models in CMIP5/6 were recombined using genetic algorithms (GAs) to create our training dataset. A deep learning model was then used to learn features from the output of these combined CMIP models so that these physical numerical models can complement each other. To address the issue of inadequate spatiotemporal feature extraction present in many deep learning methods, we devised an ENSO deep learning regression model. An improved self-attention mechanism was introduced into the convolutional LSTM (long short-term memory) network to enable our model to better extract local and global spatiotemporal features.

Computer-aided diagnosis methods are developed using artificial intelligence techniques to help earlier detection and identify hidden causes leading to cancers in skin lesion images. In skin cancer image classification problems, an ensemble of classifiers has demonstrated better classification ability than a single classification algorithm. Traditionally, training an ensemble uses the complete set of original features, where some of these features can be redundant or irrelevant and hence, may not provide useful information in generating good models for ensemble classification. Moreover, newly created features may help improve classification performance. To address this issue, the existing methods have used feature construction for building an ensemble classifier, which usually creates a fixed number of features that may fit the training data too well, resulting in poor test performance. This study develops a novel classification approach that combines ensemble learning, feature selection, and feature construction utilizing genetic programming (GP) to handle the above limitations. The proposed method automatically evolves variable-length feature vectors consisting of GP-selected and GP-constructed features suitable for training an ensemble classifier. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark real-world skin image datasets that include dermoscopy and standard camera images. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network methods, the existing GP approaches, and 11 commonly used machine learning methods. Furthermore, this study also includes interpreting evolved individuals that highlight important skin cancer characteristics playing a vital role in discriminating images of different cancer classes. This study shows that high classification performance can be achieved at a low cost of computational resources and inference time, and accordingly, this method is potentially suitable to be implemented in mobile devices for the automated screening of skin lesions and many other malignancies in low-resource settings.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Dermatology; Diseases; Feature Selection; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Oncology; Artificial intelligence techniques; Cancer detection; Cancer diagnosis; Classification performance; Diagnosis methods; Ensemble-classifier; Feature construction; Features vector; Skin cancers; Skin lesion images; Genetic programming","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198721669"

Our approach associated CNN with an explanation method to make CNN-based diagnostic decisions more understandable for a clinician. A high resolution of oral imaging is a challenge due to downsampling in several CNN networks. By optimizing the hyperparameters of CNN using Genetic Algorithms, we compensated for downsampling. Our model's hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, filter size, and learning rate, were adjusted based on performance in the validation set. Advancing further in the interpretability, we have used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, a Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation technique to indicate CNN's decision-making rationale by selecting influential regions of input images. Our proposed GA-CNN model applied to a comprehensive oral image dataset resulted in a classification accuracy of 93.7%. Our sensitivity and specificity rates were 92.5% and 94.9% improvement over other CNN models available in the literature.

CFTs have been found to have a negative impact on survivors’ mental health. This is the first study to investigate whether parents of trauma survivors experience CFTs and the association with psychological distress in this group. Objective: The main aim of the present study is to investigate CFTs in parents of trauma survivors and the relationship between the frequency and vividness of CFTs and psychological distress. Method: The participants (N = 310, 191 females) were parents of the youths targeted in the terror attack on Utøya island, Norway, in 2011. Frequency and vividness of CFTs, posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR), and symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured 8.5–9 years post-terror. Results: The majority of the parents (74%) reported having experienced CFTs at some time point since the attack. For almost one-third of the parents, CFTs were still present more than eight years after the attack. Higher frequency and vividness of CFTs were uniquely associated with higher levels of PTSR, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that frequent and vivid CFTs may contribute to mental health problems in parents of trauma survivors and should be addressed in therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature’s brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Co-evolution; Competition; Emergent communication; ES-HyperNEAT; Neuroevolution","Artificial Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Neurons; Abstracting; Brain mapping; Deep learning; Neural networks; Neurons; Co-evolution; Cognitive capability; Emergent communication; ES-HyperNEAT; High-dimensional problems; Higher-dimensional problems; HyperNEAT; Morphology structures; Neural structures; Neuro evolutions; artificial intelligence; nerve cell; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; Audition","","MIT Press Journals","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147317836"

Nevertheless, RL-based methods typically condense the evaluation of sampled compounds into a single scalar value, making it difficult for the generative agent to learn the optimal policy. This work combines self-attention mechanisms and RL to generate promising molecules. The idea is to evaluate the relative significance of each atom and functional group in their interaction with the target, and to utilize this information for optimizing the Generator. Therefore, the framework for de novo drug design is composed of a Generator that samples new compounds combined with a Transformer-encoder and a biological affinity Predictor that evaluate the generated structures. Moreover, it takes the advantage of the knowledge encapsulated in the Transformer’s attention weights to evaluate each token individually. We compared the performance of two output prediction strategies for the Transformer: standard and masked language model (MLM). The results show that the MLM Transformer is more effective in optimizing the Generator compared with the state-of-the-art works. Additionally, the evaluation models identified the most important regions of each molecule for the biological interaction with the target. As a case study, we generated synthesizable hit compounds that can be putative inhibitors of the enzyme ubiquitin-specific protein 7 (USP7). © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Despite that, in practice, this potential is not fully achieved because the solutions usually grow too much during the evolution. The excessive growth together with the functional and structural complexity of the solutions increase the computational cost and the risk of overfitting. Thus, many approaches have been developed to prevent the solutions to grow excessively in GP. However, it is still an open question how these approaches can be used for improving the interpretability of the models. This article presents an empirical study of eight structural complexity metrics that have been used as evaluation criteria in multi-objective optimisation. Tree depth, size, visitation length, number of unique features, a proxy for human interpretability, number of operators, number of non-linear operators and number of consecutive nonlinear operators were tested. The results show that potentially the best approach for generating good interpretable GP models is to use the combination of more than one structural complexity metric. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","complexity metrics; explainable AI; interpretable models","Computational complexity; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical operators; Multiobjective optimization; Complexity metrics; Computational costs; Empirical studies; Evaluation criteria; Explainable AI; Functional complexity; Interpretability; Interpretable model; Overfitting; Structural complexity; Genetic programming","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2023 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2023 Companion","15 July 2023 through 19 July 2023","Lisbon","191255","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168999727"

The explainable artificial intelligence technology, such as the Shaply additive explanation value(SHAP), enables intuitive understanding of the effect of individual variables on creep life and helps to quantitatively evaluate the effect.

This article examines the various actors and factors that have contributed to the urban revitalization of the neighborhoods in Kashan. Utilizing assemblage theory, this article constructs a relational, multiplex, and multiscalar explanation of the process of urban change. Rather than relying on the conventional understanding found in most existing gentrification studies, the aim of this study was to offer a localized interpretation of urban transformation processes. The research findings demonstrate that assemblages of human and non-human factors are shaping and reshaping the historical center of Kashan. Additionally, the findings suggest that the transformations of the historical neighborhoods of Kashan are not only due to the result of a single process but multiple urban processes occurring simultaneously within and outside the historical neighborhoods. These processes include heritage conservation (or requalification), incumbent upgrading, soft forms of revitalization, the initial stages of tourist gentrification, as well as suburbanization and urban sprawl. These dynamics are influenced by a variety of factors at political, economic, cultural, and legislative levels, operating at local, national, and global scales. We suggest that the assemblage approach can be effectively applied to study urban transformations in non-Western cities. © (2024), (Universidade de Lisboa).

In this paper, we propose a novel method to form the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) as an explainable AI to retain the model's accuracy and explainability. To achieve this purpose, we first adopted neuroevolution, which combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neural network (NN), and pruned weights to obtain information about the hierarchical decomposition of the Choquet integral. We then fine-tuned the weights of the HCI model for the classification problem. In addition, we use four datasets to illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare the results with the conventional classifiers: decision tree, deep learning, and support vector machine (SVM). The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in terms of accuracy, and keeps the Choquet integral's explainable property, justifying this paper's contribution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Explainable AI; Genetic algorithm (GA); Hierarchical Choquet integral; Neural network (NN); Neuroevolution","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Integral equations; Support vector machines; Choquet integral; Conventional algorithms; Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Hierarchical choquet integral; Neural network; Neural-networks; Neuro evolutions; Performance; Trade off; Genetic algorithms","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125544004"

Due to the lack of basic risk formation theory, previous studies focussed on the application of complex models to improve the accuracy of prediction, ignoring the interpretation of variables, while the traditional statistical analysis method can interpret variables, but the prediction accuracy is poor, which falls into a dilemma of trade-off. In this study, based on the traffic flow information of elevated expressway, an improved genetic programming (GP) approach with elite gene bank is applied to obtain an explicit traffic flow crash risk function to solve the above trade-off problem. Logistic regression and backward-propagation neural network combined with partial dependency plot were used as baseline methods to examine the interpretability and accuracy of GP. It is found that GP prediction model has been proved to be able to select important variables and solve the trade-off dilemma, which has good interpretability and accuracy. The results show that crash risk in the traffic flow mainly comes from the traffic volume, speed of the upstream section, and the speed of the current section. Furthermore, the error of GP comes from the unobserved heterogeneity and crash mechanism theory is proposed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee.","crash mechanism; genetic programming; interpretability; real-time crash risk prediction; traffic flow","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131355912"

However, these methods tend to suffer from training instability and the generators lack the ability to acquire the most discriminating features between the source and target domains, thus making the generated images of low fidelity and few texture details. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new method that combines Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Attention Mechanisms to train GANs. Specifically, from an initial CycleGAN, binary vectors indicating the activation of the weights of the generators are progressively improved upon by means of an EA. At the end of this process, the best-performing configurations of generators can be retained for image generation. In addition, to address the issues of low fidelity and lack of texture details on generated images, we make use of the channel attention mechanism. The latter component allows the candidate generators to learn important features of real images and thus generate images with higher quality. The experiments demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed method, namely, Attention evolutionary GAN (AevoGAN) alleviates the training instability problems of CycleGAN training. In the test results, the proposed method can generate higher quality images and obtain better results than the CycleGAN training methods present in the literature, in terms of Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID).  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","channel attention mechanism; evolutionary computation; Generative adversarial networks; image-to-image translation","Algorithms; Learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Image texture; Textures; Attention mechanisms; Channel attention mechanism; Content representation; Image domain; Image translation; Image-to-image translation; Learn+; Low fidelities; Network training; Target domain; algorithm; learning; Evolutionary algorithms","","World Scientific","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156170912"

In this study, responses to item #16 from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society-Health Index (ASAS HI) that explores the sleep category according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) were compared between psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial SpA (axSpA). Methods: Post hoc analysis of a multicentre cross-sectional study included a total of 201 consecutive patients. The prevalence, correlations, and disease factors associated with a positive response to item #16 were analyzed in both SpA populations. Results: Forty-eight/111 (43.2%) patients with axSpA and 42/90 (46.7%) with PsA reported sleep problems. There was a moderate–high correlation between item #16 and the ASAS HI sum score in both populations (r ≥ .59). In axSpA, poor sleep was associated with disease activity (OR 8.45, p < .001), biological therapy use (OR .24, p < .05) and CRP levels (OR .16, p < .05). In PsA, disturbed sleep was independently associated with disease activity showing a dose-response effect (OR 1.16, p < .001). Taking both populations together, disease severity (OR 6.33, p < .001) and axSpA (OR .50, p < .05) were independently associated with a positive response to item #16. Correlations between the different components of the ASAS HI and item #16 were markedly different in both populations. Conclusions: A positive response to item #16 was common in both SpA phenotypes. However, the link between inflammatory burden and disturbed sleep was higher in axSpA than in PsA. © 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología","ASAS health index; Axial spondyloarthritis; Psoriatic arthritis; Quality of life; Sleep","C reactive protein; adult; Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score; Article; Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society Health Index; axial spondyloarthritis; biological therapy; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; disease activity; Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis; disease activity score; disease association; disease burden; disease severity; female; human; International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; observational study; outcome assessment; phenotype; prevalence; psoriatic arthritis; quality of life; risk factor; sleep disorder","","Ediciones Doyma, S.L.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151698901"

The Cambridge Preliminary English Test (PET) listening section was adopted to measure L2 learners’ listening comprehension proficiency. Results from correlation analysis showed that both vocabulary and grammar measures correlated with L2 listening (r =.65 and r =.74, respectively). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the vocabulary and grammar measures jointly explained 65.7% of the variance in the listening score and that each measure made a unique contribution. It was also found that the grammar measure explained more of the variance in L2 listening than the vocabulary measure.

What the neo-neo synthesis claims as the essence of the international system is a set of conditions imposed upon international phenomena for the latter to fit into the theories themselves. It argues that the law-like explanations tailored by neorealism and neoliberalism are by no means a representation of the world as it is, but rather a predication of the world as these theories want it to be. Methodology: It critically reviews the foundations of neo-neo theories, suggesting a philosophical methodology by reframing the ontological terms of neorealism and neoliberalism based on the concept of nomological machines. Conclusions: This article contends that neo-neo theories could benefit from a capacities-oriented approach, which offers a less categorical understanding of how explanations of international phenomena are tailored, allowing alternative principles to provide invaluable insights about the international system. Originality: This paper innovates by intersecting the ideas of nomological machines with the metatheoretical debate on international relations, thus enabling theoretical improvement. © 2024 Universidad de los Andes, Colombia.

In this study, we employed a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and utilized a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization and enhancing the model's performance and robustness in deciphering emotional states from EEG signals. Our methodology encompasses data pre-processing techniques, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, applied to EEG data for feature extraction and GA-driven hyperparameter optimization to identify an optimal neural network architecture. This architecture, consisting of Convolutional and Recurrent layers with dropout regularization, is adept at extracting temporal and spatial features from EEG signals while mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, we investigate explainable AI (XAI) strategies to get insight into the decision-making process of our GA-based optimized model. Additionally, rigorous cross-validation ensures the generalization performance of the optimized model across diverse datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with the optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieving an accuracy of 93.28% in classifying 24 different emotions.

The proposed approach starts by applying K-means segmentation to the input image to cluster similar regions and colors. Next, a composite saliency map is generated based on the K-means segmentation output. Subsequently, the technique of extracting objects from the saliency map is accomplished through the employment of the connected pixel object extraction method. Ultimately, the Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize decision tree classifier for the purpose of object recognition. The MSRC dataset was utilized to assess the proposed approach, resulting in an accuracy of 81.5%, accompanied by a precision of 83.3% and recall of 86.1%.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative condition requiring new therapeutic alternatives. Safinamide, a novel levodopa add-on therapy, positively affects disease fluctuations by modulating both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. To further investigate the use of safinamide in European routine clinical practice, the present post-hoc analysis aimed to understand safinamide’s safety profile within the Spanish study population. Patients and methods. Five hundred eleven Spanish patients with PD were evaluated at baseline, four (±1), eight (±1), and 12 (±1) months after initiating safinamide treatment. Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score and UPDRS part III score during on time were used to measure the overall severity of PD and motor complications, respectively, while the severity of adverse events was evaluated following the investigators’ criteria. Results. Safinamide showed a favourable safety profile within the Spanish study population, although prescription to patients with psychiatric conditions and off-label use were more frequent than in the European study population. In Spain, clinically meaningful improvements were observed in UPDRS scores when safinamide was used as the only add-on therapy to levodopa (57.4% and 53.7% of patients) and when switching from rasagiline (55.1% of patients). Motor complications were reduced from 83.2% to 63.3% after the study period. Increased safety concerns were undetected in any patient subgroup, although patients with cognitive impairment showed a slightly higher frequency of adverse events. Conclusions. This subanalysis further supports safinamide use as a safe and efficacious option for the management of motor fluctuations in different subgroups of levodopa-treated patients. However, safinamide should be used with caution in patients with cognitive impairment. © 2023 Revista de Neurología.","Dyskinesias; Levodopa; Motor complications; Non-motor complications; Parkinson’s disease; Safinamide","Benzylamines; Humans; Levodopa; Parkinson Disease; Synapses; benserazide plus levodopa; carbidopa plus entacapone plus levodopa; carbidopa plus levodopa; levodopa; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; rasagiline; safinamide; benzylamine derivative; levodopa; safinamide; aged; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; drug tolerability; dyskinesia; European; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; motor dysfunction; observational study; Parkinson disease; post hoc analysis; prospective study; retrospective study; Spain; Spaniard; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; unspecified side effect; Parkinson disease; synapse","","Revista de Neurologia","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172688629"

Identifying these parameters usually requires unfeasible single-crystal experiments or expensive time costs due to the use of traditional genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. This study proposed an efficient and interpretable method for calibrating the constitutive parameters with macroscopic mechanical tests. This approach utilized the Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based surrogate-assisted GA (SGA) optimization method to identify a group of constitutive parameters that can reproduce the experimental stress–strain curve and crystallographic orientation by crystal plasticity simulation. The proposed approach was performed on the calibration of typical high-entropy alloy material parameters in two different CP models. The use of the surrogate model reduces the call count of simulation in the parameter searching process and speeds up the calibration significantly. With the help of infill sampling, the accuracy of this optimization method is consistent with the CP simulation and not limited by the accuracy of the surrogate model. Another merit of this method is that the pattern that the BNN surrogate found in the model parameters can be interpreted with its integrated gradients, which helps us to understand the relationship between constitutive parameters and the output mechanical response. The interpretation of BNN can guide further experiment design to decouple particular parameters and add constraints provided by the attached experiment or prior knowledge. © 2023 by the authors.","Bayesian neural network; Bayesian surrogate; crystal plasticity; genetic algorithm; interpretable calibration","","","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146500300"

In doing so, we review the validity of the expressive approach to partisanship and we test the biases that political identities can cause. Method: We use a strict measure based on a feeling thermometer regarding ordinary people depending on the party they vote for and their ideology and we pro-pose a formula to estimate the levels of difference in interpersonal political affect (DIPA). Subsequently, linear regression models were developed using data from a national representative sample survey conducted during the election campaign for the July 2023 general elections (n = 1,223). Results: Strong positive partisanship influences individual AP in a prominent way both when attitudes are expressed towards partisan or ideological groups. This contradicts the widespread discourse regarding the primacy of ideology in European multiparty systems. Moreover, we show that the overlapping between the-se two identities is not significant in explaining the phenomenon. Conclusion: AP is a group identity-based phenomenon even outside the U.S, which invites us to interpret it using the theories of social psychology. © 2024 Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.","affective polarisation; ingroup bias; intergroup relations; interpersonal attitudes; Partisanship; social identity","","","Konrad Lorenz Editores","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000129653"

How to resolve the problem of extracting hidden features and correcting abnormal data is the key factor of improving mid-term prediction accuracy. This study proposes a mid-term PV forecasting system using the De-Trend First, Attend Next strategy. The prediction system employs the detrending before attending strategy. It first adopts and corrects abnormal time series data, and then reconstructs the corrected time series data into trend and seasonal components. After data is constructed, different models are applied to trend and seasonal data for separately predictions, and such predictions then be reconstructed into a realistic prediction result. To find hidden features and seasonal trends of seasonal components, we propose a new model. This model is constructed with an encoder–decoder structure temporal convolution, and attention mechanism. This study evaluates the prediction system using data from a photovoltaic power station in Australia. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a Coefficient of Determination value of 0.992, which represents a 73% improvement in the mean squared error index compared to the baseline model. In summary, the experiment result demonstrates that the system has a good capability of providing and predicting accurate data, which plays a significant role in power grid dispatch. © 2023","Corrects abnormal; Decoder; Detrending; Encoder; Seasonal components","Australia; Decoding; Electric load dispatching; Mean square error; Signal encoding; Solar energy; Time series; Attention mechanisms; Correct abnormal; Decoder; Decoder structures; Detrending; Encoder; Encoder-decoder; Forecasting system; Prediction systems; Seasonal component; error analysis; experimental study; forecasting method; photovoltaic system; power generation; power plant; Forecasting","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175579757"

Although it is extremely important, due to the fast pace and short deadlines of contemporary projects it is often neglected or not detailed enough due to the lack of available time, leading to the potential loss of reputation, private users’ data, money, and even lives in some circumstances. In such situations, it would be vital to have the option to predict what modules are error-prone according to the collection of software metrics, and to focus testing on them, and that task is a typical classification task. Machine learning models have been frequently employed within a wide range of classification problems with significant success, and this paper proposes eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to execute the defect prediction task. A modified variant of the well-known reptile search optimization algorithm has been suggested to carry out the calibrating of the XGBoost hyperparameters. The enhanced algorithm was named HARSA and evaluated on the collection of challenging CEC2019 benchmark functions, where it exhibited excellent performance. Later, the introduced XGBoost model that uses the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two benchmark software testing datasets, and the simulation outcomes have been compared to other powerful swarm intelligence metaheuristics that were used in the identical experimental environment, where the proposed approach attained superior classification accuracy on both datasets. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was conducted to discover the impact of various software metrics on the classification results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Metaheuristics optimization; Reptile search algorithm; Software defect prediction; Software testing; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Additives; Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Defects; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Software design; Gradient boosting; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic optimization; Reptile search algorithm; Search Algorithms; Shapley; Software defect prediction; Software metrics; Software testings; Xgboost; Software testing","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167436767"

Next, a hybrid metaheuristic, a combination of binary Volleyball Premier League and Antlion optimizer will be employed to reselect the most significant features detected in the initial phase.

Subjective and objective indicators of war exposure were modelled as predictors of these symptoms. Methods: We created two predictors: first, we used governmental and crowd-sourced data to create an objective war exposure index for each of the 21 non-occupied regions of Ukraine, based on the number of air raid alarms, explosions, and proximity to frontline; and second, we obtained self-report cross-sectional data, using convenience sampling, from a nation-wide survey (N = 991) on subjective experience of threat triggered by the war. The survey also measured the outcome variables of PTSS and sleep disturbance. Hierarchical multilevel regressions modelled the relationship of this objective war exposure index with the two outcome variables, after accounting for demographics. A final regression step modelled subjective threat as predictor of these symptoms. Results: We observed strongly elevated levels of PTSS and sleep disturbance and strong regional differences in objective and subjective war indicators. Objective war exposure predicted PTSS but not sleep disturbance, whereas subjective threat predicted both symptom domains. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of objective war exposure data for predicting the prevalence of PTSS in the different regions. The results further underscore the prominent role of subjective appraisal processes in the symptomatology of PTSS and sleep disturbance, thus informing theories on trauma-related disorders. Our results can guide the allocation of mental health services by identifying highly affected regions. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this paper, we are presenting our de-identification approaches for structured data, considering the future inclusion of de-identified narrative notes and re-identification risks in the LLM era. Through literature review and collaborative consensus sessions, our team made informed decisions regarding dataset release, weighing the pros and cons of each choice, outlining limitation and bias introduced by the de-identification algorithm. To our best knowledge, this is the first study describing the rationales of de-identification decisions in the LLMs era, delineating the consequent problems that should be considered when using our data set. We advocate for transparent disclosure of de-identification decisions and associated limitations and biases with all openly available datasets. ©2024 AMIA - All rights reserved.","","Access to Information; Algorithms; Bias; Confidentiality; Data Anonymization; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; access to information; algorithm; anonymization; confidentiality; human; information dissemination; information processing; statistical bias","","","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006856956"

The framework is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO)-variational mode decomposition (VMD) combined with a time convolution network (TCN) embedded attention mechanism (Attention). The framework follows a two-step process. In the first step, PSO is applied to optimize the VMD decomposition method. The original electricity load sequence is decomposed, and the fitness function uses sample entropy to describe the complexity of the time series. The decomposed sub-sequences are combined with relevant features, such as meteorological data, to form the input sequence of the prediction model. In the second step, TCN is selected as the prediction model, and it is embedded with an attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy. The above input sequence is fed to the model to obtain the PSO-VMD-TCN-Attention prediction framework. Load datasets and various prediction models validate the PSO-optimized VMD decomposition method and the TCN-Attention prediction model. Simulation results demonstrate that the PSO-optimized VMD decomposition method enhances the model’s prediction accuracy, and the TCN-Attention prediction model outperforms other prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy and ability. © 2023 by the authors.","attention mechanism; particle swarm optimization (PSO); short-term load forecasting; time convolution network (TCN); variational mode decomposition (VMD)","Convolution; Electric power plant loads; Meteorology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Weather forecasting; Attention mechanisms; Decomposition methods; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction modelling; Short term load forecasting; Swarm optimization; Time convolution; Time convolution network; Variational mode decomposition; Variational mode decomposition","","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163806404"

However, machine learning and deep learning models are notorious for their black-box structure. To build human-friendly interpretability in stock price prediction, many studies focus on the relationship between input features and the outcome by measuring the feature importance. However, the feature-importance-based interpretability methods have such drawbacks as relative feature importance, vague importance of correlated features, and impractical interpretability. Furthermore, they overlook two principal characteristics of time series stock price data: time-dependency and collective behavior of features. As a solution to catch the collective behavior of features over a whole data period, we propose the best feature subset selection. Additionally, for the solution to reflect the time-dependent characteristic of stock price data over a short data period, we propose piecewise best feature subset selection. The proposed algorithm uses two separate input feature sets: internal technical indicators and external market prices. This bilateral forecasting scheme goes through a two-stage feature selection process composed of feature set expansion, hybridized genetic algorithm-machine learning regressions to select important features, and importance score filtering to select optimal features. Finally, the best feature subset is selected for forecasting and interpretation. The proposed method achieves the best feature subset of parsimoniously fewer features for interpretability and improves average forecasting Root Mean Squared Error by 10.42% for the optimal feature set and 13.47% for the best feature subset of the internal technical indicators. For enhanced local interpretability in this study, we use Savitzky–Golay smoothing as part of piecewise optimal curve fitting to examine each potential grouping of external features. The proposed local interpretability technique using piecewise optimal curve fitting and piecewise best feature subset provides a more timely-flexible interpretation of stock price behavior using a few best features for piecewise data segments. Compared with other feature-importance interpretability techniques that only rely on either a single data point or a whole data period, the proposed interpretability technique overcomes their limitations, and reflects the main characteristics of time series data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Collective behavior of features; Genetic algorithm feature selection; Interpretable stock forecasting; ML regression competition; Piecewise optimal curve fitting; Savitzky–Golay smoothing; Timely flexible interpretation","Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Feature Selection; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Set theory; Time series; Collective behavior of feature; Collective behaviour; Curves fittings; Features selection; Genetic algorithm feature selection; Interpretable stock forecasting; ML regression competition; Piece-wise; Piecewise optimal curve fitting; Savitzky-Golay; Savitzky–golay smoothing; Stock forecasting; Timely flexible interpretation; Genetic algorithms","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138997988"

Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, as it can slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Machine learning has shown promise in AD detection using various medical modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level stacking model that combines heterogeneous models and modalities to predict different classes of AD. The modalities include cognitive sub-scores (e.g., clinical dementia rating - sum of boxes, Alzheimer's disease assessment scale) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. In the proposed approach, in level 1, we used six base models (Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Native Bayes (NB)to train each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA). Then, we build stacking training that combines the outputs of each base model for the training set and staking testing that combines the outcomes of each model for the testing set. In level 2, three stacking models are produced for each modality that trains and evaluates based on the output of 6 base models based on (RF, LR, DT, SVM, KNN, and NB) are combined in training stacking for the training set and testing stacking for the testing set. Stacking training is used to train meta-learners (RF), and stacking testing is used to evaluate meta-learners (RF). Finally, in level 3, the output prediction of the stacking model from each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA) in the training and testing datasets is merged to build a new dataset, which is staking training and stacking testing. Training stacking is used to train the meta-learner, and the testing set is used to evaluate the meta-learner and produce the final prediction. Our research also aims to provide model explanations, ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, and trust through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Feature selection optimization based on Particle Swarm Optimization is used to select the most appropriate sub-scores. The proposed model shows significant potential for improving early disease diagnosis. The results demonstrate that the multi-modality approach outperforms single-modality approaches. Moreover, the proposed multi-level stacking models achieve the highest performance with selected features compared to regular ML classifiers and stacking models using full multi-modalities, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 92.08%, 92.07%, 92.08%, and 92.01% for two classes, and 90.03%, 90.19%, 90.03%, and 90.05% for three classes, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.","Alzheimers disease; ensemble learning; explainable artificial intelligence; Machine learning; multi-level stacking machine learning; particle swarm optimization; sub scores of cognitive","Decision trees; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical tests; Swarm intelligence; Alzheimers disease; Ensemble learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Machine-learning; Multi-level stacking machine learning; Multilevels; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Stackings; Sub score of cognitive; Swarm optimization; Support vector machines","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177190819"

Our objective was to analyse different continence definitions and predictors of urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted RP (RARP). Materials and methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (NCT03302169) including 152 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer subjected to RARP. Patients were randomised to single urethrovesical anastomosis (control arm) or PRR before urethrovesical anastomosis (PRR arm). Urinary continence was measured with the EPIC-26 and ICIQ-SF validated questionnaires, and pad use (0-1 pads and no pads), at 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days after catheter removal. Prognostic factors for early urinary continence recovery were analysed. Results: 72 patients were included in the control arm and 80 in the PRR arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms, except body mass index, which was higher in PRR arm. “No pad” was the only definition assessing the benefit of PRR at 30 days, 33.8% in PRR arm and 18.1% in control arm, p = 0.022; and at 90 days, 58.8 and 43.1% respectively, p = 0.038. Questionnaires did not detect differences in terms of continence recovery. PRR was the only predictor for early continence recovery, p = 0.03. Conclusions: PRR increased early urinary continence recovery after RARP. Continence definition was critical to assess benefit. The only predictive factor for early continence recovery was PRR. © 2022 AEU","Early urinary continence recovery; Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction; Robot assisted radical prostatectomy","Humans; Male; Prognosis; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Quality of Life; Robotics; adverse event; controlled study; human; male; procedures; prognosis; prostate; prostatectomy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; robotics; surgery","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124221193"

Topographic complexity can render these conditions quite variable across the landscape and the effects on plant ecological responses are difficult to document. We used a set of topographically defined hydrological metrics to evaluate community composition and single-species responses of four plant groups [pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes), Melastomataceae, palms (Arecaceae) and Zingiberales] to topographic conditions in the middle Juruá River region, in western Brazilian Amazonia. The area spans two geological formations (Içá and Solimões) with contrasting topography. River terraces are also found along the main rivers in the area. Local topographic conditions were approximated by height above the nearest drainage (HAND), slope, and Strahler´s drainage order, all obtained from a SRTM digital elevation model (DEM). Data were analyzed using linear and generalized linear mixed models and regression trees. HAND was most successful in explaining floristic composition for all plant groups, except for Melastomataceae, and was more important in the hilly Içá formation than in the Solimões. Individual occurrences of 57% species were predicted by at least one of the topographic variables, suggesting a marked habitat specialization along topographic gradients. For these species, response models using SRTM-DEM-derived variables gave similar results than models using field-measured topography only. Our results suggest that topographical variables estimated from remote sensing can be used to predict local variation in the structure of plant communities in tropical forests. © 2022, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

However, while considerable progress has recently been made in the machine learning based prediction of reservoir permeability, the generalization of this approach is limited by weak interpretability. Hence, an interpretable XGBoost model is proposed herein based on particle swarm optimization to predict the permeability of tight sandstone reservoirs with higher accuracy and robust interpretability. The porosity and permeability of 202 core plugs and 6 logging curves (namely, the gamma-ray (GR) curve, the acoustic curve (AC), the spontaneous potential (SP) curve, the caliper (CAL) curve, the deep lateral resistivity (RILD) curve, and eight lateral resistivity (RFOC) curve) are extracted along with three derived variables (i.e., the shale content, the AC slope, and the GR slope) as data sets. Based on the data preprocessing, global and local interpretations are performed according to the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, and the redundant features in the data set are screened to identify the porosity, AC, CAL, and GR slope as the four most important features. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is then used to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model. The prediction results of the PSO-XGBoost model indicate a superior performance compared with that of the benchmark XGBoost model. In addition, the reliable application of the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model in the prediction of tight sandstone reservoir permeability is examined by comparing the results with those of two traditional mathematical regression models, five machine learning models, and three deep learning models. Thus, the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model is shown to have more advantages in permeability prediction along with the lowest root mean square error, thereby confirming the effectiveness and practicability of this method.  © 2022 Jing-Jing Liu and Jian-Chao Liu.","","algorithm; hydrocarbon reservoir; machine learning; optimization; permeability; porosity; sandstone","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123194072"

LSTM has been applied for forecasting time series, which is generated when variables are observed at discrete and equal time intervals. Nevertheless, the problem of determining hyperparameters with a relatively high random rate will reduce the accuracy of the prediction results. This paper aims to promote LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism. PSO optimizes LSTM hyperparameters, and Bifold-attention mechanism selects the optimal input for LSTM. An accurate, adaptive, and robust time-series forecasting model is the main contribution, compared with ARIMA, MLP, LSTM, PSO-LSTM, A-LSTM, and PSO-A-LSTM. The model comparison is based on the accuracy of each model in forecasting Beijing PM2.5, Beijing Multi-Site, Air Quality, Appliances Energy, Wind Speed, and Traffic Flow. The Proposed model, LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism, has lower MAPE and RMSE than baselines. In other words, the model outperformed all LSTM base models in this study. The proposed model's accuracy is adaptable in daily, weekly, and monthly multivariate time-series datasets.

This study aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship of positivity and health-specific self-regulatory variables to health-related quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: A sample of 550 cardiac patients completed a number of instruments (positivity, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, and cardiac self-efficacy scales, and the general health questionnaire SF-12) on two occasions 9 months apart, assessing their level of positivity, health-specific self-efficacy beliefs, and health-related quality of life. Results: Mediational analyses demonstrated that healthspecific self-efficacy beliefs mediate the relationship between positivity and health-related quality of life. In terms of self-efficacy in managing negative affect, the despondency-distress factor showed both direct and indirect effects on health, while the anger factor showed only an indirect effect. The results of the structural equation model demonstrated suitable indices of fit. Conclusions: Positivity may act as a disposition helps patients to use motivational strategies related to health, be more confident in their ability to regulate their emotions, and follow the recommendations of their cardiac medical team, enabling them to perceive a higher quality of life. These findings indicate the need to promote psychosocial interventions that include these variables. © 2021 Psicothema.","Affect regulation; Cardiac self-efficacy; Cardiovascular disease; Health-related quality of life; Positivity; Self-regulation","Emotions; Humans; Quality of Life; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; emotion; human; quality of life; questionnaire; self concept","","Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111592051"

It is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus. This virus is highly infectious and relies on its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor to enter cells. With the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, the difficulty of diagnosis due to the lack of global healthcare resources becomes increasingly apparent. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis models with high generalisability can effectively alleviate this pressure. Hyperparameter tuning is essential in training such models and significantly impacts their final performance and training speed. However, traditional hyperparameter tuning methods are usually time-consuming and unstable. To solve this issue, we introduce Particle Swarm Optimisation to build a PSO-guided Self-Tuning Convolution Neural Network (PSTCNN), allowing the model to tune hyperparameters automatically. Therefore, the proposed approach can reduce human involvement. Also, the optimisation algorithm can select the combination of hyperparameters in a targeted manner, thus stably achieving a solution closer to the global optimum. Experimentally, the PSTCNN can obtain quite excellent results, with a sensitivity of 93.65% ± 1.86%, a specificity of 94.32% ± 2.07%, a precision of 94.30% ± 2.04%, an accuracy of 93.99% ± 1.78%, an F1-score of 93.97% ± 1.78%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 87.99% ± 3.56%, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 93.97% ± 1.78%. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, hyperparameter tuning of the model using an optimisation algorithm is faster and more effective. © 2023 Centro Regional de Invest.

We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length.

By drawing on intertextual qualitative source analysis, it locates the policing of the Indignados’ protests on the continuum determined by the antinomic ideal types of escalated force and negotiated management very close to the former. It aims to explain what was behind the use of escalated force by the Spanish law enforcement agencies against the 15-M Movement. Although the Indignados’ goals were not undemocratic, they were treated and fought by the law enforcement agencies precisely as criminals threatening democracy, Spain, and Spaniards. The major argument is that treating the protest movement as the enemy that had to be suppressed might have been a defense mechanism of militant democracy. Transforming the Indignados into the enemy might have resulted from fears of threatening the existing status quo and losing political elites’ own state positions. © 2022 Schedes.

We propose a simple objective function for the optimization of instance-centric CF generation problem. The PSO brings in a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying out multi-objective optimization in large dimensions, capability for multiple CF generation, and setting box constraints or immutability of data attributes. An algorithm is proposed that incorporates these features and it enables greater control over the proximity and sparsity properties over the generated CFs.

Among others, Parkinson's disease (PD) has received special attention in that it is a severe and progressive neuro-degenerative disease. As a consequence, early diagnosis would provide more effective and prompt care strategies, that cloud successfully influence patients’ life expectancy. However, the most performing systems implement the so called black-box approach, which do not provide explicit rules to reach a decision. This lack of interpretability, has hampered the acceptance of those systems by clinicians and their deployment on the field. In this context, we perform a thorough comparison of different machine learning (ML) techniques, whose classification results are characterized by different levels of interpretability. Such techniques were applied for automatically identify PD patients through the analysis of handwriting and drawing samples. Results analysis shows that white-box approaches, such as Cartesian Genetic Programming and Decision Tree, allow to reach a twofold goal: support the diagnosis of PD and obtain explicit classification models, on which only a subset of features (related to specific tasks) were identified and exploited for classification. Obtained classification models provide important insights for the design of non-invasive, inexpensive and easy to administer diagnostic protocols. Comparison of different ML approaches (in terms of both accuracy and interpretability) has been performed on the features extracted from the handwriting and drawing samples included in the publicly available PaHaW and NewHandPD datasets. The experimental findings show that the Cartesian Genetic Programming outperforms the white-box methods in accuracy and the black-box ones in interpretability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Evolutionary computation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Parkinson disease","Handwriting; Humans; Machine Learning; Parkinson Disease; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Program diagnostics; catechol methyltransferase inhibitor; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; levodopa; Cartesian genetic programming; Classification models; Classification results; Degenerative disease; Diagnostic protocols; Handwriting analysis; Parkinson's disease; Scientific community; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; cartesian genetic programming; chromosome; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; directed acyclic graph; disease classification; drawing; female; handwriting; human; image processing; machine learning; male; medical decision making; Parkinson disease; priority journal; random forest; software; support vector machine; genetics; handwriting; Parkinson disease; Genetic programming","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096493705"

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is one of the key features of wastewater treatment. Traditional monitoring methods are time consuming and have high costs making it difficult to meet the needs of rapid monitoring in practical applications. To address this issue, a method for optimizing a long short term memory (LSTM) neural network model based on adaptive hybrid mutation particle swarm optimization (AHMPSO) and an attention mechanism (AM) is proposed. As the hyperparameters of the LSTM are difficult to select, AHMPSO is used to optimize the LSTM. A nonlinear variable inertia weight with random factors is introduced to balance the global search ability and the local search ability and to improve the convergence speed of the PSO algorithm. In addition, the hybrid mutation strategy is added in the search process to reduce the risk of particles falling into local optimal solutions. Finally, an AM is added to the LSTM model to mine local water quality features to improve the effluent COD prediction accuracy. Compared with other models (LSTM, LSTM-AM, and PSO-LSTM-AM), the RMSE(the root mean square error) of the optimized model decreased by 7.803%-19.499%, the MAE(the mean absolute error) of the optimized model decreased by 9.669%-27.551%, the MAPE(the mean absolute error) of the optimized model decreased by 8.993%-25.996%, and the R2 (the coefficient of determination) value of the optimized model increased by 3.313%-11.229%.

This article assesses their role in the EU’s system of differentiated integration. To that end, it advances a model based on rational choice theory, outlining the steps and conditions under which tolerated arrangements of de facto differentiation can emerge. This is illustrated in three case studies in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): (1) Sweden’s de facto opt-out from EMU; (2) Kosovo’s adoption of the euro as sole legal tender, and (3) the Fiscal Compact. Data was gathered via document analysis and 11 expert interviews. The article concludes that de facto differentiation may constitute a viable alternative and useful means to make EU integration more flexible if strong national demand for differentiation meets the need for discretion or timely, pragmatic action. © 2022 The Author(s).

Designing seizure prediction models involves defining the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between inter-ictal brain activity and the seizure discharge. This period is typically a fixed interval, with some recent studies reporting the evaluation of different patient-specific pre-ictal intervals. Recently, researchers have aimed to determine the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between regular brain activity and a seizure. Authors have been using deep learning models given the ability of such models to automatically perform pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and handling temporal and spatial dependencies. As these approaches create black-box models, clinicians may not have sufficient trust to use them in high-stake decisions. By considering these problems, we developed an evolutionary seizure prediction model that identifies the best set of features while automatically searching for the pre-ictal period and accounting for patient comfort. This methodology provides patient-specific interpretable insights, which might contribute to a better understanding of seizure generation processes and explain the algorithm’s decisions. We tested our methodology on 238 seizures and 3687 h of continuous data, recorded on scalp recordings from 93 patients with several types of focal and generalised epilepsies. We compared the results with a seizure surrogate predictor and obtained a performance above chance for 32% patients. We also compared our results with a control method based on the standard machine learning pipeline (pre-processing, feature extraction, classifier training, and post-processing), where the control marginally outperformed our approach by validating 35% of the patients. In total, 54 patients performed above chance for at least one method: our methodology or the control one. Of these 54 patients, 21 (≈ 38%) were solely validated by our methodology, while 24 (≈ 44%) were only validated by the control method. These findings may evidence the need for different methodologies concerning different patients. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Seizures; algorithm; drug resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; epilepsy; human; procedures; seizure","","Nature Research","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126221924"

Unlike optical images, the current object detection methods have the problem of weak feature representation due to the low object resolution in SAR images. In addition, disturbed by chaotic noise, the features of classification and location are prone to significant differences, resulting in classification and location task misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel SAR ship target detection algorithm based on Cross-Attention Mechanism (CAM), which can establish the information interaction between the classification and localization task and strengthen the correlation between features through attention. In addition, to suppress the noise in multi-scale feature fusion, we designed an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module (AFFM), which uses the attention information between channels to perform the re-weighting operation. This operation can enhance useful feature information and suppress noise information. Experimental results show that on a benchmark SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), the Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone network was optimized to improve AP by 6.5% and computational cost by 0.51%.

Hypersaline lakes are good laboratories to investigate the avian cestode abundance and species diversity given the abundance of hosts (waterbirds and Artemia) and their broad latitudinal distribution. We analysed cestode infection in brine shrimp Artemia franciscana in northern (Atacama) and central Chile and compared them to results from A. persimilis in southern Chile (Patagonia). Thus, we covered a broad latitudinal gradient from 23◦ to 53◦ S. Five cestode taxa including two species of the genus Flamingolepis, Gynandrotaenia stammeri, Eurycestus avoceti, and Fuhrmannolepis averini were recorded from A. franciscana in Atacama lagoons (prevalence = 4.1%). In contrast, no cestode infection was detected in central Chile, likely because they are temporary wetlands. Parasites of flamingos and shorebirds were associated with Atacama lagoons (arid and higher salinity), while Confluaria podicipina and Fimbriarioides sp. (parasites of grebes and ducks, respectively) were dominant in Patagonian lagoons (sub-antarctic and of lower salinity). These differences mirror changes in the relative abundance of the respective final hosts. The flamingo parasite Flamingolepis sp. 1 was the most prevalent and abundant cestode in Atacama, where it was recorded only in autumn. Seasonality and habitat effects (especially abundance and phenology of different bird species) appear to override any latitudinal trends in the prevalence, diversity, and distribution of cestodes. Cestode prevalence was higher in larger wetlands but was not related to the sex of either intermediate host. We recorded a greater taxonomic richness at the cestode family level in Atacama, but a greater dominance of a single family of avian hosts (the flamingos). Ours is the first spatio–temporal study of Artemia cestodes at local and regional scales in the southern hemisphere. © 2021 by the authors.

With the recent increased interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the issue of how metaheuristics interact with XAI has attracted much attention. Most metaheuristics have stochastic search processes, and the jaguar algorithm (JA) is a unique algorithm that has exact search paths. JA shows potential abilities both in exploration and exploitation, but still faces limitations. Therefore, this study proposes a new metaheuristic based on JA and invents precision hunting behavior (PH-JA), which inherits the concept of JA and significantly strengthens its search efficiency. PH-JA improves the solution quality by adaptively detecting the current environment's trends during movement and precisely hunting prey. Then, PH-JA makes the best of the historical information to reduce the computational cost. PH-JA is an explainable metaheuristic and has systematic operational procedures in that each movement is performed according to the present situation rather than random elements. Therefore, the path to a solution is interpretable and can return the same result with the same input. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of PH-JA, which is better than other classical and state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and evaluation costs.  © 2022 IEEE.","Evolutionary Computation; Explainable AI; Jaguar Algorithm; Metaheuristics","Biomimetics; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Complex optimization problems; Explainable AI; Exploration and exploitation; Hunting behavior; Jaguar algorithm; Metaheuristic; Potential ability; Search efficiency; Solution quality; Stochastic search process; Stochastic systems","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMC)","2022 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2022","9 October 2022 through 12 October 2022","Prague","184497","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142743537"

However, whether such benefits are similarly observed in those receiving complex procedures is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the benefits of prasugrel dose de-escalation therapy are maintained in the complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) subgroup. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a post hoc analysis of the HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS trial, a randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, multicenter trial performed at 35 hospitals in South Korea. Study participants included patients with ACS who were receiving PCI. Data were collected from September 30, 2014, to December 18, 2015, and analyzed from September 17, 2020, to June 15, 2021. Interventions and Exposures: Patients were randomized to a prasugrel dose de-escalation (5 mg daily) at 1 month post-PCI group or a conventional (10 mg daily) group. Complex PCI was defined as having at least 1 of the following features: 3 or more stents implanted, 3 or more lesions treated, bifurcation PCI, total stent length 60 mm or larger, left main PCI, or heavy calcification. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main analysis end points were MACE (major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and repeat revascularization) at 1 year for ischemic outcomes, and BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) class 2 or higher bleeding events at 1 year for bleeding outcomes. Results: Of 2271 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [9.0] years; 2024 [89%] male patients) for whom full procedural data were available, 705 patients received complex PCI, and 1566 patients received noncomplex PCI. Complex PCI was associated with higher rates of ischemic outcomes but not with bleeding outcomes. Prasugrel dose de-escalation did not increase the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.47-1.66; P =.70 in complex PCI; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.45-1.46; P =.48 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.84) but decreased BARC class 2 or higher bleeding events (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.61; P =.002 in complex PCI; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.00; P =.05 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.08), albeit with wide 95% CIs.

However, most of the main DR methods are either linear (e.g., PCA), do not provide an explicit mapping between the original data and its lower-dimensional representation (e.g., MDS, t-SNE, isomap), or produce mappings that cannot be easily interpreted (e.g., kernel PCA, neural-based autoencoder). Recently genetic programming (GP) has been used to evolve interpretable DR mappings in the form of symbolic expressions. There exists a number of ways in which GP can be used to this end and no study exists that performs a comparison. In this paper, we fill this gap by comparing existing GP methods as well as devising new ones. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark datasets based on predictive accuracy and on how well the original features can be reconstructed using the lower-dimensional representation only. Finally we qualitatively assess the resulting expressions and their complexity. We find that various GP methods can be competitive with state-of-the-art DR algorithms and that they have the potential to produce interpretable DR mappings.  © 2022 ACM.","Dimensionality reduction; genetic programming; interpretability; unsupervised learning","Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Auto encoders; Data exploration; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Fitness functions; Interpretability; Isomaps; Kernel PCA; Low-dimensional representation; Symbolic expression; Genetic programming","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135204491"

Nevertheless, interpreting complex opaque models is not trivial. Current interpretability approaches rely on local explanations or produce long explanations that tend to overload the user's cognitive abilities. In this paper, we address this problem by extracting interpretable, transparent models from opaque ones via a new readability-enhanced multi-objective Genetic Programming approach called REMO-GP. To achieve that, we adapt text readability metrics into model complexity proxies that support evaluating ML interpretability. We demonstrate that our approach can generate global interpretable models that mimic the decisions of complex opaque models over several datasets, while keeping model complexity low. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Binary Classification; Genetic Programming; Interpretability; Opaque Models","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Genetic algorithms; 'current; Binary classification; Classification models; Cognitive ability; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Modeling complexity; Multi objective; Opaque model; Genetic programming","Ishibuchi H.; Kwoh C.-K.; Tan A.-H.; Srinivasan D.; Miao C.; Trivedi A.; Crockett K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS); Nanyang Technology Unversity Singapore; National University of Singapore (NUS); Singapore Management University (SMU)","2022 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2022","4 December 2022 through 7 December 2022","Singapore","186443","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147792834"

Methods: We performed a single-center post hoc retrospective analysis of data obtained from a prospective parent study (NCT04416165). This study included 34 patients diagnosed with or suspected hepatic lesions who underwent concomitant [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]-FDG/CT scans. Moreover, these patients underwent liver MRI (n = 34) and CE-CT (n = 25). Histopathologic (n = 62) or radiographic follow-up (n = 128) served as the reference standard for the final diagnosis. Results: Among the 34 patients, 20, 12, and 2 patients presented with hepatocellular carcinomas, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and benign hepatic nodules, respectively. The sensitivities of CE-CT, MRI, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04, and [18F]-FDG/CT for detecting primary liver tumors were 96%, 100%, 96%, and 65%, respectively. Regarding the diagnosis of all intrahepatic lesions, the per-lesion detection rate of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT was slightly lower than that of MRI (85% vs. 100%, P = 0.34) and significantly higher than that of [18F]-FDG PET/CT (85% vs. 52%, P < 0.001). Regarding the diagnosis of all malignant lesions (including extrahepatic disease), the tumor detection rate of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT was 87.4%, which was significantly higher than that of [18F]-FDG PET/CT (65.0%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT to correctly identify primary liver tumors and metastatic lesions is equivalent to that of CE-CT and liver MRI. Moreover, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT is better at identifying liver lesions than [18F]-FDG PET/CT, and its use may improve tumor staging, recurrence detection, and implementation of necessary treatment modifications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor; Liver Cancer; PET/CT; [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG; [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI-04","Fibroblasts; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Gallium Radioisotopes; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prospective Studies; Quinolines; Retrospective Studies; antineoplastic agent; fapi 04 ga 68; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; tracer; unclassified drug; 68Ga-FAPI; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gallium; quinoline derivative; adult; aged; Article; bile duct carcinoma; bone metastasis; cancer patient; cancer staging; carcinomatous peritonitis; chemoembolization; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; data analysis software; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver nodule; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; male; middle aged; multimodal imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; post hoc analysis; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; systemic therapy; visceral metastasis; diagnostic imaging; fibroblast; liver tumor; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prospective study; tumor recurrence","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095935903"

Some recent advances in XAI are based on Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques, such as Genetic Programming. We call this trend EC for XAI. We argue that the full potential of EC methods has not been fully exploited yet in XAI, and call the community for future efforts in this field. Likewise, we find that there is a growing concern in EC regarding the explanation of population-based methods, i.e., their search process and outcomes. While some attempts have been done in this direction (although, in most cases, those are not explicitly put in the context of XAI), we believe that there are still several research opportunities and open research questions that, in principle, may promote a safer and broader adoption of EC in real-world applications. We call this trend XAI within EC. In this position paper, we briefly overview the main results in the two above trends, and suggest that the EC community may play a major role in the achievement of XAI. © 2022 ACM.","evolutionary computation; explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; optimization","Calculations; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; AI applications; Computation methods; Evolutionary computation techniques; Explainable artificial intelligence; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Research communities; Research opportunities; Research questions; Search process; Machine learning","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","181031","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136333389"

For some vaccines, such as the measles vaccine, antibodies serve as the correlate of protection, but for others, such as human papillomavirus, the correlate of protection remains unknown. Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, in collaboration with multiple partners, developed a live recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP [ERVEBO]) containing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) in place of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus GP to prevent Ebola virus disease. Seroresponse, defined as post-vaccination GP-ELISA of 200 ELISA units (EU) per mL or higher and two-times or more above baseline, was proposed; however, correlates of protection have not been determined. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to infer possible correlates of protection for rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP. Methods: In this post-hoc analysis we included vaccinated participants with serology data from three phase 2/3 immunogenicity trials in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia (n=2199). Two of the trials were open-label, single-arm trials (one randomised [STRIVE], one non-randomised [FLW]); and one trial was randomised, placebo-controlled with two vaccine comparators (PREVAIL). Endpoints were total IgG antibody response (EU per mL) to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP measured by GP-ELISA and neutralising antibody response to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP measured by plaque reduction neutralisation test at days 14, 28, 180, and 365 after vaccination. Reverse cumulative distribution curves of the antibody concentrations were used to estimate statistical correlates of protection between 70% and 100% that might be applied to vaccine efficacy and effectiveness estimates. Findings: Although GP-ELISA and plaque reduction neutralisation tests showed similar response patterns, GP-ELISA provided a wider range of measurable titres and better differentiation for estimating correlates of protection compared with the plaque reduction neutralisation test. At day 14 after vaccination in the FLW trial, 1060 (100%) of 1060 participants had GP-ELISA levels at or above 68 EU per mL and 742 (70%) of 1060 had levels at or above 313 EU per mL. At day 28 after vaccination in the pooled population, 1953 (100%) of 1953 participants had levels at or above 73 EU per mL and 1368 (70%) of 1953 participants had levels at or above 735 EU per mL. GP-ELISA seroresponse 200 EU per mL or higher and two-times or more increase in antibody level from baseline occurred in 80% or higher of participants at each assessment and in 94% or higher of participants at any time after vaccination. Interpretation: Our results are consistent with previous work suggesting that seroresponse defined as GP-ELISA of 200 EU per mL or higher and two-times or more from baseline associated with vaccination might be the most appropriate dichotomous correlate of protection and falls within the seroprotective threshold range described herein.

However, in mining such correlations, previous methods are difficult to aggregate non-adjacent features, resulting in insufficient multi-path information extraction. In addition, the existence of the multi-path effect makes the relationship between the original CSI signal and the distance not obvious, and it is easy to cause mismatching of long-distance points. Therefore, this paper proposes an indoor localization algorithm that combines the multi-head self-attention mechanism and effective CSI (MHSA-EC). This algorithm is used to solve the problem where it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively aggregate long-distance CSI features and mismatches of long-distance points. This paper verifies the stability and accuracy of MHSA-EC positioning through a large number of experiments. The average positioning error of MHSA-EC is 0.71 m in the comprehensive office and 0.64 m in the laboratory. © 2022 by the authors.

The attention mechanism is a good solution to this problem. This paper integrates the dual attention mechanism module including spatial attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism (ISNet) into the network. Furthermore, the ISNet is added to both the encoder part and decoder part in the network. The newly proposed network is called DISNet. It can enhance target features and suppress background features, having the potential to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of the Deepglobe dataset, GID dataset, and ISPRS test project (Vaihingen) dataset is respectively 64.22, 62.83, and 78.59%. Those results are 5.68, 4.80, and 6.20% higher than that of Deeplabv3+.

However most real-world optimisation problems consist of nonlinear problems with complex constraints and conflicting objectives. The process by which a GA arrives at a solution remains largely unexplained to the end-user. A poorly understood solution will dent the confidence a user has in the arrived at solution. We propose that investigation of the variables that strongly influence solution quality and their relationship would be a step toward providing an explanation of the near-optimal solution presented by a metaheuristic. Through the use of four benchmark problems we use the population data generated by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to train a surrogate model, and investigate the learning of the search space by the surrogate model. We compare what the surrogate has learned after being trained on population data generated after the first generation and contrast this with a surrogate model trained on the population data from all generations. We show that the surrogate model picks out key characteristics of the problem as it is trained on population data from each generation. Through mining the surrogate model we can build a picture of the learning process of a GA, and thus an explanation of the solution presented by the GA. The aim being to build trust and confidence in the end-user about the solution presented by the GA, and encourage adoption of the model. © 2022 ACM.","explainability; fitness function; genetic algorithms; interpretable; optimization; surrogate model","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Population statistics; End-users; Explainability; Fitness functions; Fitness modeling; Interpretable; Metaheuristic; Optimisations; Population data; Surrogate fitness; Surrogate modeling; Genetic algorithms","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","181031","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136326745"

To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success. © 2023 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; explainable computational intelligence; explainable decision support systems; explainergy; metaheuristics","Artificial intelligence; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Complex energy; Energy domain; Energy fields; Explainable computational intelligence; Explainable decision support system; Explainergy; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic optimization; Performance; Performance of algorithm; Decision support systems","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2023","5 December 2023 through 8 December 2023","Mexico City","196107","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182921578"

We applied an interpretability model to enable investors to understand these anomalous time points in relation to companies and discover the key factors giving rise to the anomalies.

According to our literature review, the economic environment in which the adjustment takes place matters. Also, the composition of the adjustment seems to be relevant to its effectiveness, with expenditure-based plans being less contractionary (or even expansionary) than tax-based plans. Our purpose is to understand, through a VAR model, which path the Portuguese economy would have followed without the EAP. Our results suggest that the austerity programme may have been harmful to economic activity in the short run, but in a longer horizon it produced a better outcome than if the EAP had not been implemented. In the absence of the EAP, the tax to GDP ratio would have been below the current ratio, with the inverse happening for the primary public expenditure ratio and for the public debt interest rate. Overall, our results support the likelihood of less disciplined fiscal accounts in the absence of the EAP. © 2022, Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra.

The pre-ictal period determination, characterized by a transitional stage between normal brain activity and seizure, is a critical step. Past approaches failed to attain real-world applicability due to lack of generalization capacity. More recently, deep learning techniques may outperform traditional classifiers and handle time dependencies. However, despite the existing efforts for providing interpretable insights, clinicians may not be willing to make high-stake decisions based on them. Furthermore, a disadvantageous aspect of the more usual seizure prediction pipeline is its modularity and significant independence between stages. An alternative could be the construction of a search algorithm that, while considering pipeline stages’ synergy, fine-tunes the selection of a reduced set of features that are widely used in the literature and computationally efficient. With extracranial recordings from 19 patients suffering from temporal-lobe seizures, we developed a patient-specific evolutionary optimization strategy, aiming to generate the optimal set of features for seizure prediction with a logistic regression classifier, which was tested prospectively in a total of 49 seizures and 710 h of continuous recording and performed above chance for 32% of patients, using a surrogate predictor. These results demonstrate the hypothesis of pre-ictal period identification without the loss of interpretability, which may help understanding brain dynamics leading to seizures and improve prediction algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe; Humans; Precision Medicine; Seizures; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; algorithm; drug resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; human; pathophysiology; personalized medicine; seizure; signal processing; temporal lobe epilepsy","","Nature Research","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100776635"

In this context, it is fundamental to formulate policies that discourage the use of private cars. Their effectiveness involves identifying the places with greater propensity to use this modality. This article analyzes the location factors and respective explanatory variables that are most influential in the process of production trips by car during sports megaevents hosted in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ). For this purpose, we analyzed the 2013 Confederations Cup, the games of which were played in Maracanã Stadium. Initially, it was performed a literature review to establish the variables commonly used in planning transportation systems. Then it was applied the logistic regression model to the selected locational variables, aiming to identify those that best explain the trips produced by car. The performance of models with a single variable and with combinations of variables was analyzed to identify the best one to explain the car trips produced. The variables related to income and quality of life are most significant to explain this kind of produced trips, along with the existence or absence of a high-capacity mass transit system (commuter train and/or subway).

The Simplified Psoriasis Index (SPI) is a summary score with separate components for current severity (SPI-s), psychosocial impact (SPI-p), and past history and interventions (SPI-i). It is available in two similar versions: proSPI and saSPI. Aim: To assess the validity of the SPI by studying its correlation to the benchmark scores in Tunisian patients. Methods: It was a prospective bicentric study including 80 patients with plaque psoriasis. Results: The median PASI was 7.6 and the median DLQI was 9. The median proSPI-s was 6 and the median saSPI-s was 8. The median SPI-p was 7. The median SPI-i was 2. There was a strong correlation between the proSPI-s and PASI (r=0.87) and between the proSPI-s and saSPI-s (r=0.82). There was a medium correlation between saSPI-s and PASI (r=0.70) and between SPI-p and DLQI (r=0.67). The threshold value for proSPI-s and saSPI-s was 7.25. The threshold value for SPI-p was 6.5. Conclusion: The SPI aims to provide a concise but global measure of the severity and impact of psoriasis on quality of life. The use of SPI has several advantages: the simplicity of use, the additional weight given to critical locations of psoriasis, the possibility for the patient to self-assess his own disease, and the possibility of evaluating all the dimensions of psoriasis at the same time. © 2022 Maison du Medicine.

More than 200 countries are impacted due to this pandemic. To light the COVID-19 virus we need a powerful monitoring system to identify the patients and isolate them. The current detection tests are either done by measuring the body temperature or spotting the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2. These techniques are time-consuming and have a poor detection rate. Radiological images like chest X-rays are also highlighted and help in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Initial studies suggest that COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in their chest X-rays and can be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Based on this literature research, various solutions have been proposed utilizing chest X-rays to detect the SARS-CoV-2. Most of these solutions use non-public datasets and complicated structures with fewer accurate results. In our study, we propose a self-learning, interpretable model for real-time detection of COVID-19. This model utilizes a Differential evolution algorithm for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The aim is to obtain higher accuracy in detecting COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images. We have also used the LIME explanation algorithm to explain the predictability of our model and this makes our design very robust and sustainable. This fully transparent, Interpretable, and explainable model can be used in hospitals where there is a huge demand for rapid tests and radiologists are busy. © 2021 IEEE.","COVID-19; Differential evolution algorithm; SARS-CoV-2; Support Vector Machine","Diagnosis; Diseases; Evolutionary algorithms; Lime; Optimization; Support vector machines; Body temperature; COVID-19; Current detection; Daily lives; Detection tests; Differential evolution algorithms; Monitoring system; SARS-CoV-2; Support vector machine classifiers; Support vectors machine; SARS","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on Recent Developments in Control, Automation and Power Engineering, RDCAPE 2021","7 October 2021 through 9 October 2021","Noida","175483","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123872051"

By comparing three regions, Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, the article shows that de facto regional policy autonomy varies, although the regions are constitutionally symmetrical. Why do some regions have less de facto autonomy than others? Contrary to conventional expectations, party noncongruence appears less important in explaining the regional autonomy variation. Regional capacity, national integration goals and development objectives appear to have played a major role in generating de facto regional policy autonomy variation without a constitutional amendment. Regions lacking capacity and peripheral regions tend to face more centralization than others. Insights from Ethiopia imply that states embracing federalism should consider regional inequality in development and capacity in designing a federal constitution.  © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159661256"

The HIoT systems find use in several applications such as smart cities, healthcare, transportation, etc. Besides, the HIoT system and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools can be deployed in the healthcare sector for effective decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue that necessitates automated and effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at the initial stage. This article presents a new quantum-inspired differential evolution with explainable artificial intelligence based COVID-19 Detection and Classification (QIDEXAI-CDC) model for HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model aims to identify the occurrence of COVID-19 using the XAI tools on HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model primarily uses bilateral filtering (BF) as a preprocessing tool to eradicate the noise. In addition, RetinaNet is applied for the generation of useful feature vectors from radiological images. For COVID-19 detection and classification, quantum-inspired differential evolution (QIDE) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model is utilized. The utilization of the QIDE algorithm helps to appropriately choose the weight and bias values of the KELM model. In order to report the enhanced COVID-19 detection outcomes of the QIDEXAI-CDC model, a wide range of simulations was carried out. Extensive comparative studies reported the supremacy of the QIDEXAI-CDC model over the recent approaches. © 2023 Authors.

The proposed method aims to (1) accurately estimate formation energies with limited first-principles calculation data, (2) visually monitor the progress of the structure search process, (3) extract correlations between structures and formation energies, and (4) recommend the most beneficial candidates of SmFe12-substituted structures for the subsequent first-principles calculations. The structures of SmFe12 - α - βXαYβ before optimization are prepared by substituting X, Y elements—Mo, Zn, Co, Cu, Ti, Al, Ga—in the region of α + β < 4 into iron sites of the original SmFe12 structures. Using the optimized structures and formation energies obtained from the first-principles calculations after each active learning cycle, we construct an embedded two-dimensional space to rationally visualize the set of all the calculated and not-yet-calculated structures for monitoring the progress of the search. Our machine learning model with an embedding representation attained a prediction error for the formation energy of 1.25 × 10 - 2 (eV/atom) and required only one-sixth of the training data compared to other learning methods. Moreover, the time required to recall most potentially stable structures was nearly four times faster than the random search. The formation energy landscape visualized using the embedding representation revealed that the substitutions of Al and Ga have the highest potential to stabilize the SmFe12 structure. In particular, SmFe9[Al/Ga]2Ti showed the highest stability among the investigated structures. Finally, by quantitatively measuring the change in the structures before and after optimization using OFM descriptors, the correlations between the coordination number of substitution sites and the resulting formation energy are revealed. The negative-formation-energy-family SmFe12 - α - β[Al/Ga]αYβ structures show a common trend of increasing coordination number at substituted sites, whereas structures with positive formation energy show a corresponding decreasing trend. Impact statement: Seeking the next generation of high-performance magnets is a crucial demand for replacing the widely accepted Nd-Fe-B magnets developed in the middle 80s. The iron-rich compounds with the original tetragonal ThMn12 structure appear as the most potential candidates except for the hard synthesizing it in nature due to its high energy of formation. Stabilization for this material system is expected by substituting new elements, but the vast number of possible structures makes the exploration difficult even for theoretical calculations. This article proposes an integration of first-principles calculations and explainable active learning to efficiently explore the crystal structure space of this material system. In particular, the explored crystal structure space can be rationally visualized, on which the relationship between substitution elements, substitution sites, and crystal structure stabilization can be intuitively interpreted. © 2022, The Author(s).","Active learning; Materials discovery; Rare earths magnets; SmFe<sub>12</sub>","Abstracting; Aluminum alloys; Artificial intelligence; Calculations; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal structure; Data visualization; Embeddings; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Rare earths; Samarium alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Active Learning; Crystals structures; Embeddings; First principle calculations; Formation energies; Material discovery; Optimisations; Potentially stable; Rare earth magnet; [Co/Cu]; Binary alloys","","Springer Nature","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137229396"

As a result, generative and evolutionary inverse designs from the field of artificial intelligence have emerged at a rapid pace, with aims to optimize molecules for a particular chemical property. These models 'indirectly' explore the chemical space; by learning latent spaces, policies, and distributions, or by applying mutations on populations of molecules. However, the recent development of the SELFIES (Krenn 2020 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 1 045024) string representation of molecules, a surjective alternative to SMILES, have made possible other potential techniques. Based on SELFIES, we therefore propose PASITHEA, a direct gradient-based molecule optimization that applies inceptionism (Mordvintsev 2015) techniques from computer vision. PASITHEA exploits the use of gradients by directly reversing the learning process of a neural network, which is trained to predict real-valued chemical properties. Effectively, this forms an inverse regression model, which is capable of generating molecular variants optimized for a certain property. Although our results are preliminary, we observe a shift in distribution of a chosen property during inverse-training, a clear indication of PASITHEA's viability. A striking property of inceptionism is that we can directly probe the model's understanding of the chemical space on which it is trained. We expect that extending PASITHEA to larger datasets, molecules and more complex properties will lead to advances in the design of new functional molecules as well as the interpretation and explanation of machine learning models.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Cheminformatics; De-novo molecular design; Deep generative model; DeepDream; Inceptionism; Inverse design; SELFIES","Chemical properties; Deep learning; Molecules; Regression analysis; Complex properties; Functional molecules; Interpretability; Inverse regression; Learning process; Machine learning models; Molecular design; Potential techniques; Learning systems","","IOP Publishing Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111296311"

Why then do some states seek a de-judicialization yet others increased judicialization of dispute settlement mechanisms in their pursuit of regulatory space? This article advances a twofold argument. First, the concept of judicialization has been erroneously conflated with state perceptions of regulatory space under dispute settlement mechanisms. States aspiring to consolidate regulatory space may pursue de-judicialization and increased judicialization alike. Second, states' preferences for de-judicialization or increased judicialization to regain regulatory space should largely depend on conceptions of legitimate international law as either intergovernmental contracts or cosmopolitan quasi-constitutional order. The article illustrates these arguments at the example of US and EU efforts to reform the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization and investor-to-state dispute settlement. Both seek to increase regulatory space. Yet, the USA pursues de-judicialization while the EU promotes judicialization. © 2021 The Author.

Uniquely, they have a log Gaussian volume distribution and are produced from megakaryocytes, large cells that have polyploid nuclei. In this Hypothesis, we propose that a possible explanation for the origin of megakaryocytes and platelets is that, ∼220 million years ago, an inheritable change occurred in a mammalian ancestor that caused the haemostatic cell line of the animal to become polyploid. This inheritable change occurred specifically in the genetic programme of the cell lineage from which the haemostatic cell originated and led, because of increase in cell size, to its fragmentation into cytoplasmic particles (platelets) in the pulmonary circulatory system, as found in modern mammals. We hypothesize that these fragments originating from the new large haemostatic polyploid cells proved to be more efficient at stopping bleeding, and, therefore, the progeny of this ancestor prospered through natural selection. We also propose experimental strategies that could provide evidence to support this hypothesis. © 2022 Company of Biologists Ltd.

However, there are not data in the subgroup of patients with risk factors of inadequate bowel cleansing. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether a 3-day LRD improved the bowel cleansing quality in patients with risk factors of poor bowel cleansing. Patients and methods: Post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial carried out between December 2017 and March 2018 in a tertiary care hospital. Patients with high risk of poor bowel cleansing were selected following a validated score. The patients were randomized to the 1-day LRD or 3-day LRD groups. All patients received a 2-L split-dose of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted for the main outcome. Results: 135 patients (1-day LRD group = 67, 3-day LRD = 68) were included. The rate of adequate cleansing quality was not significantly different between the groups in the ITT analysis: 76.1%, 95% CI: [64.6–84.8] vs. 79.4%, 95% CI: [68.2–87.4]; odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% CI [0.54–2.73]) or in the PP analysis: 77.3%, 95% CI: [65.7–85.8] vs. 80.3%, 95% CI: [69.0–88.3]; OR 1.2, 95% CI [0.52–2.77]). Compliance with the diet or cleansing solution, satisfaction or difficulties with the LRD and the polyp/adenoma detection rates were not significantly different. Conclusion: Our results suggest that 1-day LRD is not inferior to 3-day LRD in patients with risk factors of inadequate bowel cleansing. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Boston Bowel Preparation Scale; Colonoscopy; Low-residue diet; Predictive score; Risk factors of poor bowel cleansing","Aged; Ascorbic Acid; Cathartics; Colonoscopy; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Polyethylene Glycols; Preoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Single-Blind Method; Time Factors; ascorbic acid; macrogol; ascorbic acid; laxative; macrogol; aged; Article; colon lavage; colonoscopy; controlled study; female; high risk patient; human; intention to treat analysis; intestine preparation; low residue diet; major clinical study; male; post hoc analysis; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk factor; tertiary care center; colonoscopy; diet; dietary fiber; middle aged; patient compliance; preoperative period; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; time factor","","Ediciones Doyma, S.L.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090970793"

However, its interpretability has been lacking of concrete research. Improving the stability of the feature selection method is a way to effectively improve its interpretability. A novel feature selection approach named Interpretable Particle Swarm Optimization is developed in this paper. It uses four data perturbation ways and three filter feature selection methods to obtain stable feature subsets, and adopts Fuch map to convert them to initial particles. Besides, it employs similarity mutation strategy, which applies Tanimoto distance to choose the nearest 1/3 individuals to the previous particles to implement mutation. Eleven representative algorithms and four typical datasets are taken to make a comprehensive comparison with our proposed approach. Accuracy, F1, precision and recall rate indicators are used as classification measures, and extension of Kuncheva indicator is employed as the stability measure. Experiments show that our method has a better interpretability than the compared evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, the results of classification measures demonstrate that the proposed approach has an excellent comprehensive classification performance. © 2022 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

This protection becomes of utmost importance when dealing with victims who have suffered injuries because of crime. For this reason, both India and Ukraine have given special protection to victims’ rights throughout the criminal process. This paper aims to analyze the role and degree of protection offered by these criminal procedure codes in respecting the rights of victims. Despite all the procedures put in place, the condition of the victim is still questionable, which has considerably affected the credibility of these countries’ criminal procedure codes. To determine whether they really ensure the respect of victims’ rights, a comparative methodology was used to establish the expectations of the two criminal law systems in this matter. The findings suggest that even though the criminal procedure codes of both countries have relevant provisions to protect the victims’ rights, their criminal procedure systems are still marred with issues regarding this aspect. Consequently, there is a need to revisit these codes to ensure that the rights of parties, especially those of the victims, are respected. © 2022, Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

Nine decalcination techniques, 8 dehydration protocols and 8 different techniques were applied in 3 teeth from the persons of a known age. Black and white, and color images of histological sections were captured. An x-ray was taken of each tooth and they were photographed. Researchers were asked to observe both black/white and color images of histological sections. Researchers were divided into two groups. The first group analyzed histological images only, and the second group had photos of teeth and X-rays. In the first group of observers (without X ray) the differences in age estimation between real and observed age were significant for 2 younger patients, but not for the oldest patient, where the observed and real values matched. Of the 6 raters, the assesments of the last 3 (that used x-ray images together with histological sections) did not differ significantly from the real values. Extensive analysis and multiple repetitions performed in the present investigation revealed that the most optimal method of decalcification for TCA method was EDTA II for a period longer than 14 days at a section thickness of 2-3mm, while the most optimal protocol for dehydration was number IV. When it comes to staining, the most optimal staining protocol used for the cemental lines visualization and counting was Crocein Scarlet/Acid Fuchsin staining and Toluidine blue staining used at semithin section.

While many modern ECG machines provide automated measurements of the QT-interval, these automated QT values are usually correct only for a noise-free normal sinus rhythm, in which the T-wave morphology is well defined. As QT-prolonging drugs often affect the morphology of the T-wave, automated QT measurements taken under these circumstances are easily invalidated. An additional challenge is that the QT-value at risk of TdP varies with heart rate, with the slower the heart rate, the greater the risk of TdP. This paper presents an explainable algorithm that uses an understanding of human visual perception and expert ECG interpretation to automate the detection of QT-prolongation at risk of TdP regardless of heart rate and T-wave morphology. It was tested on a large number of ECGs (n=5050) with variable QT-intervals at varying heart rates, acquired from a clinical trial that assessed the effect of four known QT-prolonging drugs versus placebo on healthy subjects. The algorithm yielded a balanced accuracy of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.99, F1-score of 0.88, ROC (AUC) of 0.98, precision-recall (AUC) of 0.88, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.88. The results indicate that a prolonged ventricular repolarisation area can be a significant risk predictor of TdP, and detection of this is potentially easier and more reliable to automate than measuring the QT-interval distance directly. The proposed algorithm can be visualised using pseudo-colour on the ECG trace, thus intuitively ‘explaining’ how its decision was made, which results of a focus group show may help people to self-monitor QT-prolongation, as well as ensuring clinicians can validate its results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Automated ECG interpretation; Drug-induced LQTS; Explainable AI; Human-like algorithm; Machine perception; QT-Prolongation; Rule-based algorithm; TdP; Torsades de pointes; Visual perception","Algorithms; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate; Humans; Long QT Syndrome; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Risk Factors; Torsades de Pointes; Artificial life; Automation; Electrocardiography; Morphology; Risk perception; Value engineering; dofetilide; quinidine; ranolazine; verapamil; drug; Automated measurement; Correlation coefficient; ECG interpretation; Healthy subjects; Human visual perception; Normal sinus rhythm; Sudden cardiac deaths; T-wave morphologies; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical practice; crossover procedure; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electrocardiogram; female; heart depolarization; heart rate; heart repolarization; human; long QT syndrome; male; predictive value; priority journal; QT interval; QT prolongation; sensitivity and specificity; single drug dose; ST segment elevation; T wave; T wave inversion; torsade des pointes; vision; algorithm; electrocardiography; heart rate; long QT syndrome; risk factor; torsade des pointes; Heart","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101108344"

Written vocabulary tests have long been used to measure L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge in studies on listening comprehension, while a limited number of studies have investigated the role of aural vocabulary knowledge to explain success in L2 listening. The current study adopts an aural receptive vocabulary test to measure L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge and a listening task to measure their L2 listening comprehension proficiency. The results show that L2 learners’ aural vocabulary knowledge significantly correlates with their listening proficiency. Although learners’ aural word knowledge at each frequency level (from 1K to 5K) and their academic word knowledge were significantly correlated with L2 listening, the strongest correlation was between academic vocabulary knowledge and listening, followed by that between word knowledge at the 5K frequency level and listening. In terms of the contribution of aural vocabulary knowledge to L2 listening, the scores achieved for the academic word knowledge measure alone explain 22% of the variance in L2 listening, and the scores achieved for the 5K word frequency level measure alone explain 16.7% of such variance. Learners’ academic vocabulary knowledge is found to explain unique variance over and above their vocabulary knowledge at the 5K word frequency level in L2 listening. © 2023 Universitat de Lleida.

A plethora of research has proposed diverse methods for individual fairness testing. However, they are suffering from three major limitations, i.e., low efficiency, low effectiveness, and model-specificity. This work proposes ExpGA, an explanation-guided fairness testing approach through a genetic algorithm (GA). ExpGA employs the explanation results generated by interpretable methods to collect high-quality initial seeds, which are prone to derive discriminatory samples by slightly modifying feature values. ExpGA then adopts GA to search discriminatory sample candidates by optimizing a fitness value. Benefiting from this combination of explanation results and GA, ExpGA is both efficient and effective to detect discriminatory individuals. Moreover, ExpGA only requires prediction probabilities of the tested model, resulting in a better generalization capability to various models. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets, show that ExpGA presents higher efficiency and effectiveness than four state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 ACM.","Explanation result; fairness testing; genetic algorithm","Efficiency; AI systems; Critical attributes; Diverse methods; Explanation result; Fairness testing; Feature values; Fitness values; Generalization capability; High quality; Prediction probabilities; Genetic algorithms","","IEEE Computer Society","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","44th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2022","22 May 2022 through 27 May 2022","Pittsburgh","180255","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131370347"

The optimal timing for non-infarct-related artery revascularization – immediate versus staged – has not been investigated adequately. Aim: We aimed to assess clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease using immediate versus staged non-infarct-related artery revascularization. Methods: Outcomes were analysed in patients from the randomized FLOWER-MI trial, in whom, after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention, non-culprit lesions were assessed using fractional flow reserve or angiography during the index procedure or during a staged procedure during the initial hospital stay, ≤ 5 days after the index procedure. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and unplanned hospitalization with urgent revascularization at 1 year. Results: Among 1171 patients enrolled in this study, 1119 (96.2%) had complete revascularization performed during a staged procedure, and 44 (3.8%) at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention. During follow-up, a primary outcome event occurred in one of the patients (2.3%) with an immediate strategy and in 55 patients (4.9%) with a staged strategy (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.39–12.69; P = 0.64). Conclusions: Staged non-infarct-related artery complete revascularization was the strategy preferred by investigators in practice in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease. This strategy was not superior to immediate revascularization, which, in the context of this trial, was used in a small proportion of patients. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these observational findings. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Acute myocardial infarction; Fractional flow reserve; Multivessel disease","Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Flowers; Fractional Flow Reserve, Myocardial; Humans; Myocardial Revascularization; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Treatment Outcome; adult; all cause mortality; angiography; artery formation (physiology); Article; cause of death; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; controlled study; female; follow up; fractional flow reserve; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; adverse event; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; flower; fractional flow reserve; heart muscle revascularization; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; treatment outcome","","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137635866"

This is the most unlikely result comparatively. The article examines what could explain this pro human rights accountability behaviour in the judiciary. It argues that the outcome could be the product of two processes initialised during the Peruvian transition: judicial empowerment (independence and power gains) and legal culture shift from positivism to neo-constitutionalism. Both are defined and analysed with reference to transitional justice and socio-legal studies scholarship.

To utilize pixel-level saliency information and discriminative local body information of the image and improve re-ID accuracy in the case of complex pose change and viewpoint difference, a person re-ID network based on attention mechanism and adaptive weight was proposed in this study. Based on the detection of human key points, an attention mechanism was integrated to screen the discriminative information in various parts of the human body. The adaptive weighting method was adopted in the network, providing the extracted local features different weights according to the discriminative information of different human parts. The re-ID accuracy of the network model was verified by experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed network model can accurately extract the features of discriminative regions in various parts of the human body by integrating the attention mechanism and adaptive region weight, thereby improving the performance of person re-ID. Our method is compared with current widely used person re-ID network models as AACN and HAC. On the Market-1501 dataset, the Rank-1 and mAP values are improved by 4.79% and 2.78% as well as 8% and 3.52%, respectively, and on the DukeMTMC-reID dataset, by 4.92% and 3.26% as well as 5.17% and 3.17%, respectively. Compared with the previous GLAD network model, Rank-1 and mAP values on two experimental datasets are increased by more than 2%. The proposed method provides a good approach to optimize the descriptor of pedestrians for person re-ID in complex environments. © 2021 Publicaciones Dyna Sl.

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly complicated but essential to provide interpretations for outlier detection results in high-dimensional space as a consequence of the large number of features. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new model based on a Variational AutoEncoder and Genetic Algorithm (VAEGA) for detecting outliers in subspaces of high-dimensional data. The proposed model employs a neural network to create a probabilistic dimensionality reduction variational autoencoder (VAE) that applies its low-dimensional hidden space to characterize the high-dimensional inputs. Then, the hidden vector is sampled randomly from the hidden space to reconstruct the data so that it closely matches the input data. The reconstruction error is then computed to determine an outlier score, and samples exceeding the threshold are tentatively identified as outliers. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a basis for examining and analyzing the abnormal subspace of the outlier set obtained by the VAE layer. After encoding the outlier dataset’s subspaces, the degree of anomaly for the detected subspaces is calculated using the redefined fitness function. Finally, the abnormal subspace is calculated for the detected point by selecting the subspace with the highest degree of anomaly. The clustering of abnormal subspaces helps filter outliers that are mislabeled (false positives), and the VAE layer adjusts the network weights based on the false positives. When compared to other methods using five public datasets, the VAEGA outlier detection model results are highly interpretable and outperform or have competitive performance compared to current contemporary methods. © 2022 by the authors.","abnormal subspace; genetic algorithm; outlier detection; variational autoencoder","Anomaly detection; Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Network layers; Signal encoding; Statistics; Vector spaces; Vectors; Abnormal subspace; Auto encoders; Curse of dimensionality; E- commerces; False positive; High dimensional data; High dimensional spaces; Model-based OPC; Outlier Detection; Variational autoencoder; Genetic algorithms","","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148726985"

This study therefore aims to advance explanations as to why there is low effectiveness of enforcement of regulations to tackle environmental crimes in extractive activities. We draw on the law enforcement literature to identify explanations for why environmental enforcement fails to deter illegal practices in extractive activities. We then take up the case of illegal mining in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the region of Madre de Dios (MDD) in the Peruvian Amazon. We evaluate qualitative data from multiple sources including legal documents, reports and interviews. The findings suggest two issues that have shaped low enforcement effectiveness in MDD: conflicts and lack of collaboration among agencies at different levels and sectors of government, and inadequate resource allocation from the national government to other levels. Enforcement is not monolithic in one governmental authority; therefore, it is crucial to recognize and address the existence of multiple levels and sectors of enforcement to improve the effectiveness of enforcement actions. These findings bear implications for theoretical perspectives on enforcement as well as public policies to increase effectiveness of enforcement of environmental regulations. © 2020","Enforcement; Environmental crimes; Illegal mining; Peru","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098683398"

To garner user trust on the model's decision-making process, it is imperative to provide faithful instance-wise justifications and rationalize the prediction in a human-readable way. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Locally Universal Rules (LURs) as model-agnostic local explanations. LURs are a subset of input words sufficient for the model to arrive at a particular prediction, even if the rest of words are perturbed slightly. We show the identification of the optimal LUR is NP-complete. Consequently, we propose a population-based algorithm LURLocator to perform the constrained optimization efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithm on a cross product of well-established text classification datasets and models. The empirical results demonstrate that LURLocator can efficiently generate high-quality local explanations, as compared to existing explanatory methods. © 2021 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

The research was based on two-year hourly data concentrations of inorganic gaseous pollutants, particulate matter, benzene, toluene, m, p-xylenes, total nonmethane hydrocarbons, and meteorological parameters obtained from the Global Data Assimilation System. In order to determine the model that will be capable of achieving a superior level of performance, eight metaheuristics algorithms were tested for eXtreme Gradient Boosting optimization, while the relative SHapley Additive exPlanations values were used to estimate the relative importance of each pollutant level and meteorological parameter for the prediction of benzene concentrations. According to the results, benzene levels are mostly shaped by toluene and the finest aerosol fraction concentrations, in the environment governed by temperature, volumetric soil moisture content, and momentum flux direction, as well as by levels of total nonmethane hydrocarbons and total nitrogen oxide. The types of conditions which provided the environment for the impact of toluene, the finest aerosol, and temperature on benzene dynamics are distinguished and described. © 2023 by the authors.","benzene; BTEX; explainable artificial intelligence; extreme gradient boosting; machine learning; metaheuristics; swarm intelligence; volatile organic compounds","Aerosols; Heuristic algorithms; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Swarm intelligence; Volatile organic compounds; BTEX; Environmental fate; Explainable artificial intelligence; Extreme gradient boosting; Fine aerosols; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Meteorological parameters; Non-methane hydrocarbons; aerosol; artificial intelligence; benzene; BTEX; concentration (composition); environmental fate; heuristics; machine learning; modeling; optimization; volatile organic compound; Optimization","","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146824348"

Accurate prediction of solar radiation is an important prerequisite for ensuring power grid security and electricity market transactions. The current mainstream solar radiation prediction method is the deep learning method, and the structure design and data selection of the deep learning method determine the prediction accuracy and speed of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) model based on the attention mechanism and genetic algorithm (AGA-LSTM). The attention mechanism is used to assign different weights to each feature, so that the model can focus more attention on the key features. Meanwhile, the structure and data selection parameters of the model are optimized through genetic algorithms, and the time series memory and processing capabilities of LSTM are used to predict the global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance after 5, 10, and 15 min. The proposed AGA-LSTM model was trained and tested with two years of data from the public database Solar Radiation Research Laboratory site of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The experimental results show that under the three prediction scales, the prediction performance of the AGA-LSTM model is below 20%, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy compared with the continuous model and some public methods. © 2022 by the authors.

This is especially true for high-stakes areas such as real estate valuation. Unfortunately, the methods applied there often exhibit a trade-off between accuracy and explainability. One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision is supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting in accuracy. The unexplainable machine learning approaches are often observed to provide higher accuracy but are not scrutable in their decision-making. In this paper, we apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to CBR predictors in order to improve their performance. In particular, we deploy EAs to the similarity functions (used in CBR to find comparable cases), which are fitted to the data set at hand. As a consequence, we achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), while keeping interpretability and explainability. These results stem from our empirical evaluation on a large data set of real estate offers where we compare known similarity functions, their EA-improved counterparts, and DNNs. Surprisingly, DNNs are only on par with standard CBR techniques. However, using EA-learned similarity functions does yield an improved performance.  © 2022 ACM.","case-based reasoning; Evolutionary algorithms; neural networks; real estate valuation","Decision making; Deep neural networks; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Casebased reasonings (CBR); High standards; High-accuracy; Human lives; Machine learning approaches; Neural-networks; Performance; Real estate valuations; Similarity functions; Trade off; Case based reasoning","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135214921"

Understanding the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-perceived symptom severity in psoriasis is key to clinical decision-making. Objectives: This post hoc analysis of the PSO-LONG trial data assessed the impact of long-term proactive or reactive management with fixed-dose combination calcipotriene 50 µg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g (Cal/BD) foam on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: Five hundred and twenty-one patients from the Phase 3, randomized, double-blind PSO-LONG trial were included. An initial 4-week, open-label phase of fixed-dose combination Cal/BD foam once daily (QD) was followed by a 52-week maintenance phase, at the start of which patients were randomized to a proactive management arm (Cal/BD foam twice weekly) or reactive management arm (vehicle foam twice weekly). Patient-perceived symptom severity and HRQoL were assessed using the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the EuroQol-5D for psoriasis (EQ-5D-5L-PSO). Results: Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed across all PRO measures. The mean difference (standard deviation) from baseline to Week 4 was −8.97 (6.18) for PSI, −6.02 (5.46) for DLQI and 0.11 (0.15) for EQ-5D-5L-PSO scores. During maintenance, patients receiving reactive management had significantly higher DLQI (15% [p = 0.007]) and PSI (15% [p = 0.0128]) and a numerically lower EQ-5D-5L-PSO mean area under the curve score than patients receiving proactive management (1% [p = 0.0842]). Conclusions: Cal/BD foam significantly improved DLQI, EQ-5D-5L-PSO and PSI scores during the open-label and maintenance phases. Patients assigned to proactive management had significantly better DLQI and PSI scores and numerically better EQ-5D-5L-PSO versus reactive management. Additionally, baseline flare was associated with worse PROs than the start of a relapse, and patients starting a relapse also had worse PROs than patients in remission. © 2021 The Authors.

This study aims to fill the empirical void by conducting analyses of governing parties’ unity in legislative voting. We argue that presidential popularity matters for explaining variation in vote unity of governing parties because presidential approval is an important psychological component in executive-legislative relations. Focusing on deputies from the incumbent parties in roll-call votes for executive-sponsored bills in Mexico from 1998 through 2018, we find that the level of a governing party’s unity increases with higher presidential approval. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests and to controlling for potential endogeneity. © 2021, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile 1.

Many traffic classification methods have been proposed for classifying encrypted traffic by utilizing a deep learning model without inspecting the packet payload. However, they have an important challenge in that the mechanism of deep learning is inexplicable. A malfunction of the deep learning model may occur if the training dataset includes malicious or erroneous data. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can give some insight for improving the deep learning model by explaining the cause of the malfunction. In this paper, we propose a method for explaining the working mechanism of deep-learning-based traffic classification as a method of XAI based on a genetic algorithm. We describe the mechanism of the deep-learning-based traffic classifier by quantifying the importance of each feature. In addition, we leverage the genetic algorithm to generate a feature selection mask that selects important features in the entire feature set. To demonstrate the proposed explanation method, we implemented a deep-learning-based traffic classifier with an accuracy of approximately 97.24%. In addition, we present the importance of each feature derived from the proposed explanation method by defining the dominance rate. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Its economy was historically developed through farming activities, but from the eighties decade of the past century, it became dependent on the sendee sector, with tourism being a fundamental economic basis. La Gomera's tourism model has revolved around the classic ""sun and beach"" combination, favoring its concentration in a few coastal areas in the south, which has led to a profound territorial polarization -from an economic and demographic point of view- between these places and the rest of the island. As a consequence, there has been an almost total abandonment of the island territory, which is now instrumentalized as a tourism promotion product, supported by the idealization of the landscape as a natural and cultural heritage, being presented as a bucolic space that seduces and captivates visitors staying on the coast, who are the main consumers of these interior and northern areas of the island, but which contributes little to the poor economy of the inhabitants residing in these areas. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

To deal with this problem, we propose an outlier detection model based on Variational Autoencoder and Genetic Algorithm for subspace outlier analysis of high-dimensional data (VAGA). The proposed VAGA model constructs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to preliminarily detect outliers. Then the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search the abnormal subspace of the outliers obtained by the VAE layer to provide a basis for subspace outlier analysis. The subsequent clustering of the abnormal subspaces help filter out the false positives which are fed back to the VAE layer to adjust network weights. The comparative experiments performed on three public benchmark datasets show that the outlier detection results of the proposed VAGA model are highly interpretable and have better accuracy performance than the state-of-the-art outlier detection methods. © 2021 IEEE.","genetic algorithm; outlier detection; variational autoencoder","Anomaly detection; Benchmarking; Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Network layers; Signal encoding; Statistics; Auto encoders; Curse of dimensionality; Data space; Datapoints; Detection models; High dimensional data; Model-based OPC; Outlier analysis; Outlier Detection; Variational autoencoder; Genetic algorithms","Chen Y.; Ludwig H.; Tu Y.; Fayyad U.; Zhu X.; Hu X.T.; Byna S.; Liu X.; Zhang J.; Pan S.; Papalexakis V.; Wang J.; Cuzzocrea A.; Ordonez C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura Collaboration Drives Results; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; Lyve Cloud; NSF; Seagate","2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021","15 December 2021 through 18 December 2021","Virtual, Online","176404","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125317052"

Our goal was to analyze intraoperative crystalloid volume administration practices and their association with postoperative outcomes. Methods: We extracted clinical data from two multicenter observational studies including adult patients undergoing colorectal surgery and total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA). We analyzed the distribution of intraoperative fluid administration. Regression was performed using a general linear model to determine factors predictive of fluid administration. Patient outcomes and intraoperative crystalloid utilization were summarized for each surgical cohort. Regression models were developed to evaluate associations of high or low intraoperative crystalloid with the likelihood of increased postoperative complications, mainly acute kidney injury (AKI) and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: 7,580 patients were included. The average adjusted intraoperative crystalloid infusion rate across all surgeries was to 7.9 (SD 4) mL/kg/h. The regression model strongly favored the type of surgery over other patient predictors. We found that high fluid volume was associated with 40% greater odds ratio (OR 1.40; 95% confidence interval1.01-1.95, p = 0.044) of postoperative complications in patients undergoing THA, while we found no associations for the other types of surgeries, AKI and LOS Conclusions: A wide variability was observed in intraoperative crystalloid volume administration; however, this did not affect postoperative outcomes. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor","Crystalloid; Fluid therapy; Postoperative complications","","","Elsevier Doyma","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103058988"

However, the surgery effect on bleeding rates and other clinical joint outcomes can be unclear. Aim: To investigate the effects of joint surgery on joint annualized bleeding rates (JABRs) and physical health outcomes in patients with haemophilia A undergoing N8-GP prophylaxis. Methods: Patients in the pathfinder 2 trial received N8-GP prophylaxis, enrolling in the pathfinder 3 trial for indicated surgery. Patients returned to pathfinder 2 post-surgery, continuing N8-GP prophylaxis until end-of-trial. JABRs were calculated from bleeding across all joints for pre-surgery (immediately before surgery) and post-surgery (to pathfinder 2 study end) periods. Joint-health-related outcomes were derived from patient records. Results: Data (41 joint surgeries; n = 30) were analysed statistically using datamining and descriptively. Pre-surgery mean JABR was higher in patients who later were operated than in 146 non-operated patients (p =.004). In operated patients, mean JABR decreased from 1.33 pre-surgery to.37 post-surgery (p =.011). In all but three patients, JABR improved or remained the same post-surgery. In the three patients whose JABR remained at one (all with multiple joint arthropathy), post-surgery bleeds were mostly at non-operated sites. Two of the three patients whose JABR increased post-surgery had undergone surgery for reasons unlikely to improve JABR. Mobility parameters often improved in patients whose JABR remained at zero. Conclusion: Patients with haemophilia treated with N8-GP prophylaxis benefit from surgeries. However, this analysis could not differentiate the relative contributions of surgical interventions and prophylactic treatment to the improvement of JABR. © 2021 The Authors.

In what follows, I will discuss some of the characteristics of counterfactual narratives, explain how they might be tailored to take more than a century of ethnographic practice into account, and offer three counterfactual ethnographic scenarios by way of illustration. Toward the end of the essay, which I hope will also serve as a beginning, I offer brief reflections on what sort of distinctive contribution counterfactual ethnography might make at a time when anthropologists have increasingly embraced the notion that a good part of anthropology’s value for the wider society lies in an ethnographic record stuffed with examples of creative possibilities for what it means to be human. © 2021, Asociacion de Antropologos Iberoamericanos en Red.

Methods: We evaluated data from three Phase 2/3 clinical trials conducted in Liberia (PREVAIL), Guinea (FLW), and Sierra Leone (STRIVE) during the 2013–2016 West African EVD outbreak to assess immune responses using validated assays. We performed a post hoc analysis of the association of vaccine response with sex, age (18–50 yrs & >50 yrs), and baseline (BL) GP-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titer (<200 & ≥200 EU/mL), including individual study (PREVAIL, FLW, or STRIVE) data and pooled data from all 3 studies. The endpoints were total IgG antibody response (EU/mL) measured by the GP-ELISA and neutralizing antibody response measured by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP at Days 28, 180, and 365 postvaccination. Results: In the overall pooled population, in all subgroups, and in each trial independently, GP-ELISA and PRNT geometric mean titers increased from BL, generally peaking at Day 28 and persisting through Day 365. Immune responses were greater in women and participants with BL GP-ELISA ≥ 200 EU/mL, but did not differ across age groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP elicits a robust and durable immune response through 12 months postvaccination in participants regardless of age, sex, or BL GP-ELISA titer. The higher immune responses observed in women and participants with pre-existing immunity are consistent with those described previously and for other vaccines.

Many visualization methods have been proposed, including the well-regarded state-of-the-art method t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. However, the most powerful visualization methods have a significant limitation: the manner in which they create their visualization from the original features of the dataset is completely opaque. Many domains require an understanding of the data in terms of the original features; there is hence a need for powerful visualization methods which use understandable models. In this article, we propose a genetic programming (GP) approach called GP-tSNE for evolving interpretable mappings from the dataset to high-quality visualizations. A multiobjective approach is designed that produces a variety of visualizations in a single run which gives different tradeoffs between visual quality and model complexity. Testing against baseline methods on a variety of datasets shows the clear potential of GP-tSNE to allow deeper insight into data than that provided by existing visualization methods. We further highlight the benefits of a multiobjective approach through an in-depth analysis of a candidate front, which shows how multiple models can be analyzed jointly to give increased insight into the dataset. © 2013 IEEE.","Feature selection (FS); genetic programming (GP); t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding; visualization","Algorithms; Data Mining; Data Visualization; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Large dataset; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Baseline methods; In-depth analysis; Model complexity; Multiobjective approach; State-of-the-art methods; Stochastic neighbor embedding; Visual qualities; Visualization method; algorithm; data mining; Data visualization","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091175420"

As a personality characteristic highly contextualized in stressful circumstances, resilience was expected to have a mediating role in this relationship. Method: A sample of 2,722 Slovene adults, aged from 18 to 82 years filled in the Big Five Inventory, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum. A path analysis with the Bootstrap estimation procedure was performed to evaluate the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between personality and psychological functioning. Results: Resilience fully or partially mediated the relationships between all the Big Five but extraversion with subjective well-being and stress experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outburst. Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of less adaptive psychological functioning both directly and through diminished resilience. Conclusions: Resilience may be a major protective factor required for an adaptive response of an individual in stressful situations such as pandemic and the associated lockdown. © 2020 Asociación Española de Psicología Conductual","Big five; COVID-19 pandemic; Ex post facto study; Psychological functioning; Resilience","","","Elsevier Doyma","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096402202"

To what extent do they do so as a result of various bureaucratic and fiscal incentives? The literature has documented several explanatory frameworks in the context of China that predominantly focus on the realm of developmental policies. Owing to the salient characteristics of the social policy arena, local adaptation of centrally designed policies may operate on distinctive logics. This study synthesizes the recent scholarship on subnational social policymaking and explains the significant interregional disparities in China's de facto urban poverty line - the eligibility standard of the urban minimum livelihood guarantee scheme, or dibao. Five research hypotheses are formulated for empirical examination: fiscal power effect, population effect, fiscal dependency effect, province effect and neighbour effect. Quantitative analysis of provincial-level panel data largely endorses the hypotheses. The remarkable subnational variations in dibao standards are explained by a salient constellation of fiscal and political factors that are embedded within the country's complex intergovernmental relations and fiscal arrangements. Both a race-to-the-top and a race-to-the-bottom may be fostered by distinctive mechanisms. The unique role of provincial governments as intermediary agents within China's political apparatus is illuminated in the social policy arena.

The research uses data from Eseb (2002 – 2018) and Lapop (2010 – 2019). The results indicate that: 1) there is an increase in polarization, but it is predominantly affective and more intense in relation to the candidates; 2) although there are already some signs in 2014, affective polarization is much more visible in 2018; 3) in ideology, evidence indicates a growth and radicalization of the right, which may eventually contribute to a polarization. Given this evidence, it is concluded that the specific characteristics of Brazilian polarization are related to aspects of our political context, both long-term, such as the reduced social base of the parties, and more recent ones, such as the reorganization of the right and moderation of PT. In common with other countries, there is, in Brazil, the concentration of polarization in politically engaged individuals. © 2022, Opiniao Publica.

Current target-generic methods typically disentangle identity features in the latent space, using adversarial training to balance privacy and utility. However, this pattern often leads to a trade-off between privacy and utility, and the latent space remains difficult to explain. To address these issues, we propose IDeudemon, which employs a ""divide and conquer""strategy to protect identity and preserve utility step by step while maintaining good explainability. In Step I, we obfuscate the 3D disentangled ID code calculated by a parametric NeRF model to protect identity. In Step II, we incorporate visual similarity assistance and train a GAN with adjusted losses to preserve image utility. Thanks to the powerful 3D prior and delicate generative designs, our approach could protect the identity naturally, produce high quality details and is robust to different poses and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IDeudemon outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.","","Computer vision; 'current; De-identification; Divide-and-conquer; Generative design; Generic method; High quality; Trade off; True identity; Two step method; Visual similarity; Economic and social effects","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2023","2 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Paris","196783","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185877516"

One of challenges in de novo molecular generation is how to produce new reasonable molecules with desired pharmacological, physical, and chemical properties. To improve the similarity between the generated molecule and the starting molecule, we propose a new molecule generation model by embedding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Attention mechanism in CycleGAN architecture, LA-CycleGAN. The network layer of the generator in CycleGAN is fused head and tail to improve the similarity of the generated structure. The embedded LSTM and Attention mechanism can overcome long-term dependency problems in treating the normally used SMILES input. From our quantitative evaluation, we present that LA-CycleGAN expands the chemical space of the molecules and improves the ability of structure conversion.

It will not only affect the dispatch and operation of the distribution network, bring hidden dangers to the security of the power grid, but also damage the operating costs of power companies and disrupt the operation of the power market. Aiming at users' abnormal electricity consumption behavior, this paper proposes a model based on particle swarm optimization and long-short term memory with the attention mechanism (PSO-Attention-LSTM). Firstly, according to the actual electricity theft behavior, six typical electricity theft modes are summarized, and 4 composite modes are obtained by combining them, so as to comprehensively test the detection performance of the model for various electricity theft behaviors. Secondly, a detection model based on PSO-Attention-LSTM is proposed, and the model is built using the TensorFlow framework. The model uses the attention mechanism to give different weights to the hidden state of LSTM, which reduces the loss of historical information, strengthens important information and suppresses useless information. Use PSO to solve the difficult problem of model parameter selection, and optimize the hyperparameters to improve the model performance.

We take as a starting point the proposal of the theories on values proposed by Juan Díez Nicolás to dwell on the modernization theory of Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel and, specifically, on their formulation of the culturalist thesis and their classification of cultural regions. Our analysis rejects the explanation of confidence in women’s organizations taking these cultural regions as the subject of analysis, so we take countries and individuals as units of analysis. We present several multilevel models whose results show that postmaterialist values continue to be significant in explaining the variance in trust toward women’s organizations between countries. At the individual level, sex, age, educational level, income, family size, attendance at religious services, political ideology and the use of new media also help to explain the greater or less trust in women’s organizations. In the discussion, we raise some consequences that derive from our results. © 2023, Universia Holding.

While training on ever-larger portions of the internet leads to consistent performance improvements, the size of these improvements diminishes with scale, and there has been little work exploring the effect of data selection on pre-training and downstream performance beyond simple de-duplication methods such as MinHash. Here, we show that careful data selection (on top of de-duplicated data) via pre-trained model embeddings can speed up training (20% efficiency gains) and improves average downstream accuracy on 16 NLP tasks (up to 2%) at the 6.7B model scale. Furthermore, we show that repeating data intelligently consistently outperforms baseline training (while repeating random data performs worse than baseline training). Our results indicate that clever data selection can significantly improve LLM pre-training, calls into question the common practice of training for a single epoch on as much data as possible, and demonstrates a path to keep improving our models past the limits of randomly sampling web data. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Genetic Programming is usually utilised to handle UCARP by evolving effective routing policies, which can respond to the uncertain environment in real-time. Previous studies mainly focus on the effectiveness of the routing policies but ignore the interpretability. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc interpretability, which explains a pre-trained complex routing policy. Unlike the existing explanation methods for classification/regression models, the behaviour of a routing policy is characterised as a ranking process rather than predicting a single output. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Local Ranking Explanation (LRE) method for GP-evolved routing policies for UCARP. Given a UCARP decision situation, LRE trains a linear model that gives the same ranks of the candidate tasks as those of the explained routing policy. The experimental results demonstrate that LRE can obtain more interpretable linear models that have highly correlated and consistent behaviours with the original routing policy in most decision situations. By analysing coefficients and attribute importance of the linear model, we managed to provide a local explanation of the original routing policy in a decision situation.  © 2022 ACM.","Genetic Programming; Hyper-Heuristic; Local explanation; Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Network routing; Capacitated arc routing problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Decision situation; Hyper-heuristics; Interpretability; Linear modeling; Local explanation; Real-world; Routing policies; Uncertain capacitated arc routing problem; Genetic programming","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135225263"

Embedding constructivist insights within a rational principal–agent model, this article advances a five-step sequential process that nuances the traditional explanation of delegitimation. It argues that entrepreneurs must first successfully promote the belief that the high costs of ineffective private policies follow from the private rule-setter's flawed institutional attributes. Subsequently, a de-delegation solution that minimizes transaction and uncertainty costs must be proposed. The examination of two cases in the field of international sport governance, namely the deliberate reversal of private authority in anti-doping governance and the lack thereof in anti-match-fixing governance, lends support to these propositions. It sheds new light on the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and explains why there will probably be no counterpart to fight match-fixing. © 2020 The Authors.

The aim of this research is to identify the different scenarios of electoral success for radical right parties in ten European countries between 2008 and 2019. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) - a case-oriented technique which allows indepth comparative examination and which is based on the concepts of equifinality and causal heterogeneity -, we test the role of several causal conditions related to some demand-side and supply-side explanations. Our results reveal four sufficient causal paths that lead to the success of these parties, which confirm that they are able to achieve relevance in quite diverse contexts. The four paths combine both demand-side and supply-side conditions, but the role of the latter is qualitatively and quantitatively more important. In particular, we see how radical right parties can effectively take advantage of favorable political competitive dynamics, even in the absence of a priori favorable socio-economic contexts. Overall, our findings run contrary to some mechanistic explanations in the literature and support the idea of conceiving of the radical right parties as a complex, multiform phenomenon which needs to be understood through both theoretical and methodological innovations. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

It is found that an undercompensation of UST when it was redeemed played a significant role in the de-pegging event, with the UST price on cryptocurrency exchanges following the redeemed value of UST that users could obtain by swapping UST for LUNA and selling it on the market.

By segmenting myocardium DE-MRI images, it provides critical information for the evaluation and treatment of myocardial infarction. As a consequence, it is vital to investigate the segmentation and classification technique of myocardial DE-MRI. Methods: Firstly, an end-to-end minimally supervised and semi-supervised semantic DE-MRI myocardial fibrosis segmentation framework is proposed, which combines image classification and semantic segmentation branches based on the self-attention mechanism. Following that, a residual hole network fused with the dual attention mechanism was built, and a double attention metabolic pathway classification method for cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI images was developed. Results: By adding pixel-level labels to an extra 40 training images, the segmentation model may enhance semantic segmentation performance by 2.6 percent (from 61.2 percent to 63.8 percent). When the number of pixel-level labels is increased to 80, semi-supervised feature extraction increases by 4.7 percent when compared to weakly guided semantic segmentation. Adding an attention mechanism to the critical network DRN (Deep Residual Network) can increase the classifier's performance by a small amount. Experiments revealed that the models worked effectively. Conclusion: This paper investigates the segmentation and classification of cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI data using a semi-supervised semantic segmentation and dual attention mechanism, dealing with the issue that existing segmentation algorithms have difficulty segmenting myocardial fibrosis tissue. In the future, we can consider optimizing the design of the attention module to reduce the module computation. © 2022","Cardiac Image Classification; DE-MRI; Dual Attention Mechanism; Myocardial Fibrosis; Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","Algorithms; Fibrosis; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Semantics; Cardiology; Heart; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pixels; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Cardiac image classification; Cardiac images; Delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; Dual attention mechanism; Images classification; Myocardial fibrosis; Semantic segmentation; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised semantic segmentation; Article; classification algorithm; controlled study; convolutional neural network; delayed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; entropy; feature extraction; heart muscle fibrosis; human; human tissue; image analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; segmentation algorithm; semantics; algorithm; fibrosis; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; semantics; Image classification","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136014699"

Aim: To assess long-term efficacy and pharmacokinetic outcomes with fixed-dose N8-GP prophylaxis. Methods: Descriptive analyses were performed on data from the pathfinder 2 and pathfinder 5 trials of patients with severe haemophilia A. Bleed frequency and reoccurrence were assessed in relation to several clinical criteria of interest. Bleed risk relative to time since last dose was assessed using calculated annualised bleeding rate (ABR). Long-term ABR and mean factor VIII (FVIII) trough levels were assessed in patients who received consistent N8-GP prophylaxis every 4 days (Q4D). Results: During pathfinder 2, 117/136 patients with study-drug exposure of ≥600 days experienced bleeding episodes; 8.6% of bleeds were reoccurring bleeds; bleed reoccurrence decreased over time. For patients who received consistent Q4D prophylaxis across the trial (n = 61), mean ABR decreased from 3.5 bleeds/year (Year 1) to 1.6 bleeds/year (Year 6); mean FVIII trough levels stabilised at approximately 5% (Year 6). Across patients who received prophylaxis at some point during pathfinder 2 (n = 177), 125/126 (99%) reoccurring bleeds were joint bleeds. For patients receiving Q4D prophylaxis, bleeding risk generally increased as the time since the last prophylaxis dose increased. A similar reduction in ABR and stabilisation of trough level was observed in pathfinder 5. Conclusion: Long-term exposure (> 5 years) to fixed-dose N8-GP prophylaxis resulted in a protective haemostatic effect, with reduction in bleed frequency and reoccurrence, and stabilisation of FVIII trough level over time. © 2021 The Authors.

This work aims to fill this gap by developing the Escala de Explicaciones de la Violencia Filioparental (EEVFP), an instrument to measure APV explanations given spontaneously by ordinary people. Method: The sample was composed of 763 men and women aged 15 to 79, with and without offspring. Results: Using a cross-validation procedure based on factorial analysis, the scale’s underlying structure that best fit the data included six factors: Poor Parenting, Inadequate Environment, Emotional Reaction, Adolescence, and Evil/Madness. Evidence on the relationship between EEVFP and the Revised Scale of Causal Dimensions was also provided, as well as on differences in explanations due to gender and having children. Conclusions: The results provide sufficient evidence of reliability and validity to consider EEVFP a useful tool in APV research exploring the relationship between APV explanations and subsequent behavior. This research may be helpful in training practitioners and in designing intervention strategies that avoid blaming parents and increase support from their surroundings. © 2021 Psicothema www.psicothema.com.","Adolescent-to-parent violence; Attributions; Causal explanations; Gender differences; Revised scale of causal dimensions","Adolescent; Anger; Female; Humans; Male; Parenting; Parents; Reproducibility of Results; Violence; adolescent; anger; child parent relation; female; human; male; reproducibility; violence","","Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117335447"

Since the publication of William Riker's (1962) seminal book, a variety of coalition models has been developed to explain government formation and breakdown. Nevertheless, despite the diversity of models, the literature seems to judge their predictability solely in terms of empirical tests, usually deriving hypotheses from their propositions and testing via statistics. In this work, I survey classical and more recent formal models in coalition theory, demonstrating how they serve different purposes. I build a taxonomy of models that acknowledges these purposes, and, more importantly, the roles they play in building explanations about coalitions. I identify three types of models: conceptual models, whose conceptual and theoretical value relies on the mathematical deductions entailed in the model; quasi-conceptual models, which formalise explanations of regularities in the real world; and extrapolative models, which allow for an empirical test of formal models via a variety of statistical methods. All of these types of models coexist, generating explanations and setting research agendas. © 2019, Asociacion Espanola de Ciencia Politica y de la Administracion.; Las teorías de las coaliciones son uno de los campos que se ha beneficiado enormemente de modelos formales en la ciencia política.

Construyo una taxonomía de los modelos que reconoce estas funciones, y lo más importante, los papeles que juegan en la construcción de explicaciones sobre coaliciones.

In view of growing scientific interest in understanding this type of discrimination and considering that scientific knowledge shapes the way a phenomenon is understood and addressed, this paper aims at identifying theoretical perspectives and categories used in contemporary scientific research (2005-2016) to explain discrimination against trans people. A review of literature and a qualitative content analysis of the selected documents (N = 68) were carried out. Two broad theoretical perspectives were identified: cognitive approaches and discursive approaches. The limitations of the two approaches are discussed in terms of how the problem of transphobia and discrimination is framed and explained and the scope for action offered. To overcome such limitations, a conceptual distinction between gendered practices and transphobic attitudes and ideology is suggested and an alternative theoretical proposal using discursive psychology is presented. © 2020.

UCARP has a wide range of real-world applications. One of the main challenge in UCARP is to handle the uncertain environment effectively. Routing policy-based approaches are promising technique for solving UCARP as they can respond to the uncertain environment in the real time. However, manually designing effective routing policies is time consuming and heavily replies on domain knowledge. Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic (GPHH) has been successfully applied to UCARP to automatically evolve effective routing policies. However, the evolved routing policies are usually hard to interpret. In this paper, we aim to improve the potential interpretability of the GP-evolved routing policies by considering both program size and number of distinguished features. To this end, we propose a Two Stage Multi-Objective Genetic Programming Hyper Heuristic approach with Feature Selection (TSFSMOGP). We compared TSFSMOGP with the state-of-the-art single-objective GPHH, a two-stage GPHH with feature selection and a two-stage Multi-Objective GP. The experimental results showed that TSFSMOGP can evolve effective, compact, and thus potentially interpretable routing policies. © 2020 IEEE.","Feature Selection; GPHH; Routing policy; UCARP","Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intelligent computing; Network routing; Stochastic systems; Capacitated arc routing problem; Domain knowledge; Interpretability; Multi objective; Routing policies; Single objective; State of the art; Uncertain environments; Genetic programming","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2020","1 December 2020 through 4 December 2020","Virtual, Canberra","166370","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099714215"

In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), specialized neurocritical care is often required, but whether it affects clinically significant outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine the association of the intensity of care on mortality and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in critically ill patients with severe TBI. Methods: We conducted a post hoc analysis of a multicentre retrospective cohort study of critically ill adult patients with severe TBI. We defined the intensity of care as a daily cumulative sum of interventions during the intensive care unit stay. Our outcome measures were all-cause hospital mortality and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Results: Seven hundred sixteen severe TBI patients were included in our study. Most were male (77%) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 42 (20.5) yr and a median [interquartile range] Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 [3-6]. Our results showed an association between the intensity of care and mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.74) and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79). Conclusion: In general, more intense care was associated with fewer deaths and a lower incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in critically ill patients with severe TBI. © 2018, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.","","Adult; Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; adult; Article; cohort analysis; critically ill patient; disease severity; female; Glasgow coma scale; hospital mortality; human; incidence; intensity of care; intensive care unit; life sustaining treatment; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; patient care; post hoc analysis; priority journal; retrospective study; traumatic brain injury; treatment withdrawal; aged; clinical trial; critical illness; intensive care; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; proportional hazards model; traumatic brain injury","","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048532571"

PSO was used to obtain an optimal variable combination for linear or nonlinear models. For nonlinear modeling, a set of 44 nonlinear transforms were developed for each single descriptor. To enable model interpretability and reduce the risk of overfitting, the total descriptors were divided into subclasses and the selected variables were forced to be sparsely distributed in each subclass. Model complexity was controlled by adjusting the maximum total number of variables included. Accurate linear and nonlinear PSO-SR models were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS) and validated by randomly and repeatedly splitting the data into training and test objects for 500 times. The best predictions were obtained with 10 variables with linear (Q2=0.9460) and nonlinear (Q2=0.9505) models. The results indicate PSO-SR could provide an effective and useful strategy for modeling and interpreting complex QSSR problems. The proposed nonlinear modeling method could provide more information for model interpretation by probing and catching the unknown nonlinear relationship between a descriptor and the observed selectivity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Metalloporphyrin catalysts; Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR); Quantitative structure-selectivity relationship (QSSR); Selective oxidation; Sparse regression (SR)","2 nitrobenzaldehyde; 2 nitrotoluene; aromatic compound; metalloporphyrin; unclassified drug; algorithm; Article; biomimetics; catalyst; chemical structure; complex formation; correlational study; linear regression analysis; molecular dynamics; nonlinear regression analysis; oxidation; particle swarm optimization based sparse regression; prediction; predictor variable; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum chemistry; synthesis; validation study","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999635685"

In the study reported here, the structure and interactional prompt of the narrations, explanations and argumentations that occur at mealtimes at home are analysed; specifically, 181 discourse units self-recorded in the homes of 11 four-year-old children from the Argentine middle class were analysed.

Understanding Greater Prairie-Chicken response to human disturbance, including the effects of anthropogenic noise and landscape modification, is vital for conserving remaining populations because these disturbances are becoming more common in grassland systems. Here, we evaluate the effect of low-frequency noise emitted from a wind energy facility on habitat selection. We used the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index, a ratio of human-generated and biological acoustic components, to determine the impact of the dominant acoustic characteristics of habitat relative to physical landscape features known to influence within-home range habitat selection. Female Greater Prairie-Chickens avoided wooded areas and row crops but showed no selection or avoidance of wind turbines based on the availability of these features across their home range. Although the acoustic environment near the wind energy facility was dominated by anthropogenic noise, our results show that acoustic habitat selection is not evident for this species. In contrast, our work highlights the need to reduce the presence of trees, which have been historically absent from the region, as well as decrease the conversion of grassland to row-crop agriculture. Our findings suggest physical landscape changes surpass altered acoustic environments in mediating Greater Prairie-Chicken habitat selection. Copyright © 2019 American Ornithological Society.

Early DAPT de-escalation is a new non-inferior alternative to 12-months DAPT in patients with biomarker positive ACS treated with stent implantation. In this post-hoc analysis of the TROPICAL-ACS trial, which randomized 2610 ACS patients to a PFT-guided DAPT de-escalation (switch from prasugrel to clopidogrel) or to control group (uniform prasugrel), we compared clinical outcomes of patients (n=151) who received a BVS during the index PCI. The frequency of the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or BARC≥2 bleeding) was 8.8% (n=6) in the de-escalation group vs. 12.0% (n=10) in the control group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26–1.98, p=0.52) at 12 months. One early definite stent thrombosis (ST) occurred in the control group (day 19) and 1 possible ST (sudden cardiovascular death) in the de-escalation group (day 86), both despite prasugrel treatment and in a background of high on-treatment platelet reactivity assessed at day 14 after randomization (ADP-induced platelet aggregation values of 108 U and 59 U, respectively). A PFT-guided DAPT de-escalation strategy could potentially be a safe and effective strategy in ACS patients with BVS implantation but the level of platelet inhibition may be of particular importance. This hypothesisgenerating post-hoc analysis requires verification in larger studies with upcoming BVS platforms. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bioresorbable vascular scaffold; Clopidogrel; Platelet function testing; Prasugrel","Absorbable Implants; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Clopidogrel; Drug Substitution; Female; Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Platelet Function Tests; Prasugrel Hydrochloride; Thrombosis; Tissue Scaffolds; Young Adult; antithrombocytic agent; clopidogrel; prasugrel; acute coronary syndrome; adolescent; adult; aged; biodegradable implant; bleeding; blood clotting parameters; blood vessel transplantation; chemically induced; clinical trial; complication; controlled study; drug substitution; female; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; randomized controlled trial; thrombosis; tissue scaffold; very elderly; young adult","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061297788"

The largest countries in Latin America were subjected to common international economic pressures during both the neoliberal 1980s and 1990s – including the expansion of capital markets in the periphery and integration into the regional trade agreements NAFTA and Mercosur – and the post- 1998 financial turmoil. By 2015, however, the three countries had consolidated alternative commercial banking systems: domestic private group dominated (Brazil), mixed (i.e., ownership more evenly divided among public, private domestic, and foreign banks (Argentina), and foreign bank dominated (Mexico).

It has been noted that the past tense behaves non-canonically in counterfactual constructions in several unrelated languages, since it does not seem to convey pastness. A similar behavior is found in Karitiana, a Tupian language that belongs to the future vs. non-future system. It is the non-future that is used non-canonically in counterfactuals in Karitiana. Some authors posit that the past tense has a modal interpretation in counterfactual environments (JAMES, 1982; FLEISCHMAN, 1989; IATRIDOU, 2000; PALMER, 2001; van LINDEN; VERSTRAETE; 2008). Others posit that tense is just tense in these environments (IPPOLITO, 2002, 2003; ARREGUI, 2005). The goal of this paper is to describe the semantics of counterfactual sentences in Karitiana, and show that the language supports the Tense as Tense approach to counterfactuals. Thus, bringing data from Karitiana becomes relevant because, besides giving a description of counterfactuality in the language, it brings data from a typologically distinct language to bear on the choice between two important theoretical approaches. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Faculdade de Letras.

On one hand, the residual structure enables the network to go deeper, therefore more features can be extracted from the input data. On the other hand, attention mechanism is designed to adaptively recalibrate dynamic channel-wise information, which makes better use of the hidden features. Taking these advantages, the proposed method shows superior prediction accuracy on both amino acid level and peptide level in a series of experiments.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Agricultural robots; Computer vision; Mass spectrometry; Robotics; Attention mechanisms; Database information; De novo peptide sequencing; Experimental spectra; Network structures; Prediction accuracy; Residual structure; Tandem mass spectrometry; Peptides","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","16th IEEE International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, ICARCV 2020","13 December 2020 through 15 December 2020","Virtual, Shenzhen","166416","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100092677"

Clearly, it is important to understand and minimize any risks to health or the environment posed by the presence of ENMs. Data-driven models that decode the relationships between the biological activities of ENMs and their physicochemical characteristics provide an attractive means of maximizing the value of scarce and expensive experimental data. Although such structure–activity relationship (SAR) methods have become very useful tools for modelling nanotoxicity endpoints (nanoSAR), they have limited robustness and predictivity and, most importantly, interpretation of the models they generate is often very difficult. New computational modelling tools or new ways of using existing tools are required to model the relatively sparse and sometimes lower quality data on the biological effects of ENMs. The most commonly used SAR modelling methods work best with large datasets, are not particularly good at feature selection, can be relatively opaque to interpretation, and may not account for nonlinearity in the structure–property relationships. To overcome these limitations, we describe the application of a novel algorithm, a genetic programming-based decision tree construction tool (GPTree) to nanoSAR modelling. We demonstrate the use of GPTree in the construction of accurate and interpretable nanoSAR models by applying it to four diverse literature datasets. We describe the algorithm and compare model results across the four studies. We show that GPTree generates models with accuracies equivalent to or superior to those of prior modelling studies on the same datasets. GPTree is a robust, automatic method for generation of accurate nanoSAR models with important advantages that it works with small datasets, automatically selects descriptors, and provides significantly improved interpretability of models. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Decision trees; genetic-programming; nanoSAR; nanotoxicology; QSAR","Animals; Cell Line; Computational Biology; Decision Trees; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Nanostructures; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Structure-Activity Relationship; Surface Properties; nanomaterial; accuracy; algorithm; Article; automation; computer program; controlled study; cytotoxicity; decision tree; genetic programming based decision tree construction tool; human; human cell; keratinocyte; nanotechnology; priority journal; structure activity relation; animal; biology; cell line; chemistry; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; structure activity relation; surface property; theoretical model","","Taylor and Francis Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962359284"

Chief among these are the various ""measurement axioms"" and in particular the Born rule expressing the probability distribution of measurement outcomes. Compared to other candidate non-orthodox quantum theories, the pilot-wave theory suffers from something of an embarrassment of riches in regard to explaining the Born rule statistics, in the sense that there exist, in the literature, not just one but two rather compelling proposed explanations. This paper is an attempt to critically review and clarify these two competing arguments. We summarize both arguments and also survey some objections that have been given against them. In the end, we suggest that there is somewhat less conflict between the two approaches than existing polemics might suggest, and that indeed elements from both arguments may be combined to provide a unified and fully-compelling explanation, from the postulated dynamical first principles, of the Born rule. © 2018 by the authors.","Bohmian mechanics; Born rule statistics; Measurement problem; Pilot-wave theory","","","MDPI AG","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048716526"

Nevertheless, the EU has mixed feelings about it: while recognizing the initiative's capability to foster economic growth, it is still reluctant to participate, regarding the BRI as a challenge to European unity, norms and values. Regardless of the official stance of the European Commission, the EU member states have adopted a wide range of heterogeneous stances towards the BRI, ranging from an enthusiastic acceptance of the initiative to a refusal to join it. This paper will shed light on the driving factors behind this wide range of attitudes towards the BRI, focusing not only on the economic opportunities posed by the initiative to the main member states, but also on their relationship with the EU and the possible internal tensions with the European Commission. The joint examination of these two variables will provide a better explanation of EU member states' stance towards the BRI than those analyses based merely on the explanation of economic factors. In fact, the main finding of this paper is that political factors outweigh the economic ones: there is no correlation between the economic opportunities offered by the initiative and the support it gets from beneficiary member states, while internal tensions inside the EU are encouraging some member states to join the initiative even though there might not be many economic benefits granted by their participation. © 2019 Asociacion Espanola de Profesores de Derecho internacional y Relaciones internacionales.

Despite being protected from ocean waves, the lagoon, which is popular with tourists, is a dangerous place to swim, with an average of 8-9 drownings each year. The present paper examines the longshore and rip currents in the lagoon as the potential cause for these fatalities. Drifters were deployed for measuring the magnitude and direction of the nearshore currents. Unidirectional, northwards, longshore currents, with velocity up to 1.4ms-1 and strong rip currents, with velocity up to 3.4ms-1, 5-10m width and duration of less than 5 minutes, were observed. The observed rip currents pose a real danger even to experienced swimmers, hence it is concluded that they are the major cause of the deaths. The areas of major incidence of rip currents were identified. The result allows us to recommend a zoning of the beach into three areas as follows. The southern part, with weak currents, is classified as a ""safe area"", flagged green, and is recommended for swimming. The northern part, with strong rip currents, is classified as a ""hazardous area"", flagged red, and prohibited for swimming. In the intermediate zone, classified as a ""moderate area"" and flagged yellow, swimmers should proceed with caution. Regular patrols by lifeguards and beach assistants are highly recommended during the summer, the peak tourism season. © 2019 UNIVALI.

Schooling of older children, however, still shows room for improvement especially among the more vulnerable. Fortunately, during the last years a sizeable improvement in attendance rates for children aged 15 through 17 took place. This could be related to the 2006 National Education Law that made upper-secondary education compulsory. In this paper, instead, we claim that the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance, AUH) —a massive conditional cash transfer program implemented in 2009 in Argentina— may be mostly responsible for this improvement. Using a difference-in-difference strategy we estimate that the program accounts for a 3.9 percentage point increase in the probability of attending secondary school among eligible children aged 15 through 17.

Our work is based on the analysis of the scientific literature including original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis. Methodology: In order to identify the most pertinent studies in the electronic search, the three following databases were systematically searched: PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. For both the analysis and synthesis we selected original articles, literature reviews as well as meta-analysis referring to any cognitive explanation of the auditory hallucinatory experience in schizophrenia. A cognitive model of auditory hallucinations refers to any incorporation of cognitive frameworks and explanations in one's conceptualization of the hallucinatory phenomenon in schizophrenia. We also focused our work on past conceptualization of auditory hallucinations in order to explain the development and the contribution of current cognitive models in the understanding of the onset and the maintaining of AVHs. After a brief review of clinical characteristics and historical conceptualization of auditory verbal hallucinations, contemporary explanations were presented in the area of schizophrenia. These explanations referred to researches into cognitive psychopathology including metacognitive as well as neuroimaging studies. Results: The examination of scientific literature highlighted the complexity of AVHs through multifactorial explanations here mostly explained by cognitive and metacognitive deficits. We synthesized former conceptualizations of AVHs, which were sustained on mechanistic or sensory explanations. Esquirol, Baillarger and Briere de Boismont were the first as conceiving AVHs as a perception disorder and introduced the idea that auditory hallucinations resulted from a failure to control one's memories/fantasies. Later, Broca and Wernicke discovered auditory areas in the human brain implicated in language comprehension and production. AVHs began to be conceptualized by the scientific world as being mechanistically brain-related. Sigmund Freud was among the first to study the meaning of AVHs, a domain still being investigated by todays cognitive sciences. More recently, neuroimaging studies allowed the validation of these sensory explanations in considering the onset of AVHs through the deficit of cortical and subcortical areas implicated in the process of languages (e.g. Broca and Wernicke areas) and emotions (e.g. limbic system, amygdala, hippocampus). At a more mechanistic level, contemporary cognitive models of AVHs explained AVHs as an intrusive verbal representation into the awareness which is non-inhibited (i.e. deficit in intentional inhibition) and also non-recognized as one's own experience (i.e. deficit in source monitoring, planning and metacognition), or even attributed to an external source (attribution bias). In terms of inhibitory control, inhibition is a basic cognitive mechanism defined as a collection of processes that allows the suppression of previously activated cognitive contents and the clearing of irrelevant actions or attention from consciousness. Intentional inhibition is effortful and occurs when an individual deliberately suppresses the activation of an item after deciding it is irrelevant. Theoretical support for the suggestion that an inhibitory failure is involved in AVHs in schizophrenia arises from studies that have shown that a failure in inhibition results in intrusive thoughts from long-term memory. Recent findings also found that individuals with AVHs in schizophrenia demonstrated an impaired source monitoring. In episodic memory research, a distinction was made between content (an event) and context (e.g. source or temporal characteristics of an event) information. The context of memories provides cues that allow an individual to differentiate one memory from other memories. AVHs are conceptualized as a failure to access the contextual cues that would allow voice-hearer to form an intact representation of events in memories. Regarding planning, AVHs refer to the intrusion of unwanted memories into the inner speech that are not recognized from one's own representation. Previous cognitive theories highlighted the important role played by metacognitive skills and belief (i.e. thinking about one's thinking) in the explanation of AVHs. Finally, the external attribution bias was extensively studied over the last three decades and refers to the tendency to attribute negative events (situational or cognitive) to an external source. In this framework, AVHs refer to intrusive thoughts externally attributed to a voice. Conclusion: For more than one century, scientific discoveries in (bio)medical science have allowed the validation of former sensory and mechanistic explanations of AVHs. Nevertheless, many explanatory models account for the way AVHs are maintained (source monitoring, deficit in planning, externalizing bias), while they scarcely expose how they are triggered (intrusive thoughts, deficit in inhibition).

Previously, we showed that aripiprazole may protect motivational function by preserving reinforcement-related signals used to sustain reward-maximization. However, the effect of aripiprazole on more cognitive facets of human reinforcement learning, such as learning from the forgone outcomes of alternative courses of action (i.e., counterfactual learning), is unknown. To test the influence of aripiprazole on counterfactual learning, we administered a reinforcement learning task that involves both direct learning from obtained outcomes and indirect learning from forgone outcomes to two groups of Gilles de la Tourette (GTS) patients, one consisting of patients who were completely unmedicated and the other consisting of patients who were receiving aripiprazole monotherapy, and to healthy subjects. We found that whereas learning performance improved in the presence of counterfactual feedback in both healthy controls and unmedicated GTS patients, this was not the case in aripiprazole-medicated GTS patients. Our results suggest that whereas aripiprazole preserves direct learning of action-outcome associations, it may impair more complex inferential processes, such as counterfactual learning from forgone outcomes, in GTS patients treated with this medication. © 2017 The Author(s).","","Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Case-Control Studies; Dopamine Agonists; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Psychometrics; Reinforcement (Psychology); Task Performance and Analysis; Tourette Syndrome; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; case control study; drug effect; female; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; human; learning; male; pathophysiology; psychology; psychometry; reinforcement; task performance","","Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025816494"

Based on the works by Humberto Maturana and on the theory of affects in Spinoza’s Ethics, we assume that human beings are moved by passions and formulate the circuit of affects of drug addiction. In this circuit, we have identified three affective complexes: the singular personal complex, the relief/oblivion complex, and the psychosocial complex, which form a spiral dynamics of sad affects. Such affects impel the individual to continue in this dynamics, and drugs play only an accessory role. Affects from different origins characterize each affective complex and understanding their particular and specific features guides the corresponding care action, in order to interrupt the spiral dynamics of the circuit. © 2021, Fundacao UNI Botucatu/UNESP.

In brief, an agent is free to the extent that she determines herself to do that which she deliberately judges to be the best from several considered options that she could have brought about, had she come to the deliberative conclusion that these options were best.

However, some olives of the Erkence cultivar naturally de-bitter on the tree giving rise to the so-called Hurma olives. In this study, the evolution of the chemical characteristics of Erkence and Hurma olives harvested from the northeast and southwest area of trees located in the Karaburun Peninsula was assayed. It was confirmed that the oleuropein content in Hurma olives was much lower (< 2000 mg/kg fresh weight) than Erkence, which reached 35.000 mg/kg fresh weight at the beginning of the season. In addition, no free or polymerized anthocyanins were found in Hurma fruit in contrast to ripened Erkence fruit. The concentration of glucose was also lower in Hurma than Erkence olives. These results suggest that the enzymatic oxidation of oleuropein could be responsible for the natural de-bittering of Hurma olives during their ripening on the tree. © 2017 CSIC.","Anthocyanin; Bitterness; Olive; Phenolic compounds; Sugar","Anthocyanins; Fruits; Sugars; Bitterness; Chemical characteristic; Enzymatic oxidations; Fresh weight; Oleuropein; Olive; Phenolic compounds; Forestry","","Instituto de la Grasa","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016728437"

Yet, the political silence that permeates through the ranks of the fan bases of Istanbul’s ‘big’ clubs is puzzling as the country slowly decays into authoritarianism. What explains this silence and the surprising apolitical disposition of fans? I argue that a multi-layered de-politicization process hangs over Turkish soccer, nested within a web of clientelistic relations that stretches from the state to the clubs and fan groups. The military’s heavy-handed approach to suppressing political expressions of all sorts for several years following the 1980 coup helped ensure the de-politicization of soccer stadiums. Likewise, as major beneficiaries of state funds and sponsorships, soccer clubs sought to avoid political trouble and were actively involved in discouraging fan groups from political activism. Empirically, the article focuses primarily on the post-1980 period and the ‘big three’ of Istanbul, i.e. Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","","","Routledge","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015760275"

Method: data were collected from the COVID-19 reports of the Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, Chile. Curve adjustment studies were developed with the data in four different models: quadratic, exponential, simple exponential smoothing, and double exponential smoothing. The significance level used was α≤0.05. Results: the curve that best fits the evolution of the accumulated confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chile is the doubly-smoothed exponential curve. Conclusion: the number of infected patients will continue to increase. Chile needs to remain vigilant and adjust the strategies around the prevention and control measures. The behavior of the population plays a fundamental role. We suggest not relaxing restrictions and further improving epidemiological surveillance.

This paper explains why. It argues that the two interwoven trends of political and criminal pluralization in Mexico fostered the conditions for a new type of criminal violence against politicians. Mexican politicians are now targeted for accepting illicit money as well as for standing up to criminals. Moreover, this violence is evidence of an alarming and persistent pattern in Mexico of politicians enlisting criminal organizations to eliminate their political competition. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, this paper shows there is a strong statistical relationship between the increase in assassinations and the increases in political pluralization and criminal fragmentation. The article concludes that the failure to protect local public officials creates greater opportunities for the emergence of subnational authoritarian enclaves and threatens democratic consolidation. © 2017, GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies.

So far, much of the research on the topic has been grounded in Relative Deprivation Theory (RDT). Offering an alternative theoretical lens to explain chieftaincy conflict, this article draws on historical institutionalism and, in a more systematic way, on the concepts of critical junctures and path dependence, to explain the nature of the Ga Mashie chieftaincy conflict during Ghana’s Fourth Republic (1993–present). Grounded in a qualitative case study method and drawing on original interview data, the article argues that the imposition of colonial and postcolonial political structures with no roots in precolonial political offices has led to conflicting interpretations of who the rightful successor to the Ga Mashie throne is. Contested versions of the customs and traditions of the Ga people, with particular reference to succession, exist, leading to ongoing chieftaincy conflict. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group, on behalf of the University of Witwatersrand.","chieftaincy conflict; critical junctures; Ga Mashie; Ghana; historical institutionalism; path dependence","","","University of Witwatersrand","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056153176"

Fifteen male high level managers leading team leaders, and 61 employees (30 women and 31 men) responded to a questionnaire in which they had to assess the desirability of the reasons given by a team leader for which he/she unfairly punished his subordinates: it might be either getting angry with them despite their good work (negative sanction) or, on the contrary, refraining intervention when they made mistakes (positive sanction). The results indicate a disaccountability of both the receiver and the distributor of the sanction, with, instead, the highlighting of contextual determinants, especially in case of negative sanction.

Especially for industrial systems, domain experts are more likely to deploy autonomously learned controllers if they are understandable and convenient to evaluate. Basic algebraic equations are supposed to meet these requirements, as long as they are restricted to an adequate complexity. Here we introduce the genetic programming for reinforcement learning (GPRL) approach based on model-based batch reinforcement learning and genetic programming, which autonomously learns policy equations from pre-existing default state–action trajectory samples. GPRL is compared to a straightforward method which utilizes genetic programming for symbolic regression, yielding policies imitating an existing well-performing, but non-interpretable policy. Experiments on three reinforcement learning benchmarks, i.e., mountain car, cart–pole balancing, and industrial benchmark, demonstrate the superiority of our GPRL approach compared to the symbolic regression method. GPRL is capable of producing well-performing interpretable reinforcement learning policies from pre-existing default trajectory data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Genetic programming; Industrial benchmark; Interpretable; Model-based; Reinforcement learning; Symbolic regression","Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Regression analysis; Algebraic equations; Batch reinforcement learning; Industrial systems; Interpretable; Model-based OPC; Straight-forward method; Symbolic regression; Trajectory data; Reinforcement learning","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053756406"

We investigated the influence of oral prednisolone on indices for de novo lipogenesis (DNLi), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCDi) and Δ6-desaturase (D6Di) activity in healthy males. In addition, we explored whether the changes may be associated with prednisolone-induced changes in glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Thirty-two healthy young males (mean ± SD age 22 ± 3 years, BMI 22.4 ± 1.7 kg/m2) were allocated to receive prednisolone 7.5 mg/day (PRED7.5; n = 12), prednisolone 30 mg/day (PRED30; n = 12), or placebo (n = 8) in a randomized double-blind fashion for 2 weeks. Fatty acid compositions of plasma cholesteryl esters (CE), phospholipids (PL) and triglycerides (TG) were measured at baseline and on day 14. DNLi, SCDi and D6Di were estimated from product/precursor ratios in CE, with DNLi primary deriving from 16:1ω7/18:2ω6, SCDi from 16:1ω7/16:0 and D6Di from 22:6ω3/20:5ω3. Ratios were also assessed in PL and TG. In CE, PRED30 increased DNLi by 51.2 [95%CI 14.8; 87.6]%, increased SCDi by 48.6 [18.7; 78.5]%, and decreased D6Di by 57.7 [-91.8; -23.5]% (p ≤ 0.01 for all, compared to placebo). The prednisolone-induced increases in DNLi and SCDi were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity (r = 0.35 and 0.50, respectively). Similar results were found in PL and TG. Prednisolone dose-dependently increases DNLi and SCDi and decreases D6Di in plasma CE, PL and TG in healthy males after 2 weeks. The observed unfavorable effects on fatty acid metabolism were related to the induction of glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fatty acids; Glucocorticoid; Glucose; Hepatic DNL; Insulin sensitivity; Prednisolone","Administration, Oral; Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol Esters; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Gene Expression; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase; Lipid Metabolism; Lipogenesis; Male; Phospholipids; Prednisolone; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Triglycerides; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; antiinflammatory agent; cholesterol ester; linoleoyl coenzyme A desaturase; phospholipid; prednisolone; triacylglycerol; adult; blood; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug administration; drug effect; gene expression; genetics; glucose blood level; human; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; male; normal human; oral drug administration; randomized controlled trial","","Churchill Livingstone","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045101651"

These factors are non-malleable and are not within educational agents' reach. So that, once the effect of the socioeconomic context on assessment was controlled, we focused the study on the role that variables related to educational regional policy, to schools' institutional culture and to the teaching practices play on schools performance in PISA. For this purpose we carried out a secondary analysis with data of 976 secondary schools distributed along the 17 regions of Spain participating in PISA-2015 assessment cycle, and also with data about public/private enrolment, educational spending and available resources of the regional systems. We have built successive multilevel regression models -through a hierarchical linear analysis- in order to know the role of schools and educational policy of all the Spanish regions on the explanation of schools' scientific competence. Findings focused on educational policy variables show that student-teacher ratio and the quantity of computers by classroom do matter on achievement. About the incidence on the performance of schools’ variables we found out that the school climate and the teaching practices have significant effects on outcomes. Students’ disruptive behaviour and teachers’ disrespectful interaction with pupils are both variables related to a lower level of competence. Nevertheless, efficacy in the classroom management, a direct teaching approach and the adaptation of the teaching activities to students’ needs are variables related to a higher level of competence. Students’ support and feedback exists when a low-level of scientific competence is founded. Finally, some proposals have emerged from these findings in order to do better at schools and to redirect educational policy. © 2017, Ministry Education and Science.

While this explanation may have some merit, it is certainly inadequate. Instead, we argue that public property commons degrade partially because governments, in their attempt to obtain an overall societal balance, sometime accord low priority to some resources and bestow their ownership to an agency that may lack the appropriate mandate. While for many governments, this tendency is deliberate, it results in a de jure public property commonly exhibiting de facto open-access status and creates a situation where anybody may benefit but nobody feels responsible for the conservation and management of such resources. Based on the policy and institutional analyses of mangrove management in the Indus Delta of Pakistan, we propose such a case for theoretical debate on the issue. We conclude that instead of packaging and allocating rights to a single entity, rights in complex CPRs may be defined and allocated separately to different entities to produce socially desired goods and services. No matter how complex it seems, such an arrangement is necessary to deal with the complexity inherent in various socio-ecological systems like mangroves. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Indus delta; Institutional analysis; Mangroves; Natural resources management; Policy analysis; Public property commons","Article; community integration; developing country; ecosystem; environmental protection; forestry; mangrove; packaging; Pakistan; policy; priority journal","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988002788"

It can also be called a post hoc analysis, which often includes a deep analysis of an athlete’s performance, behavior and body characteristics after a race. These analyses help trainers to adapt their training plan according to the athlete’s performance on the one hand, and to modify the strategy or tactic of the racing on the other. Until recently, rare solutions of automatic analysis, using modern artificial intelligence tools, were proposed. In this paper, recent solutions are reviewed and a novel solution is proposed, which relies on heart rate data for post hoc analysis. Here, the main focus is on individual sports, where the performed time determines the quality of results (e.g., running, cycling and triathlon). The proposed solution was tested on two case studies of running athletes. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Sport science; Sport training; Trainers","Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Artificial intelligence tools; Automatic analysis; Differential Evolution; Quality of results; Sport performance; Sport science; Trainers; Training plan; Sports","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045031493"

From a resilience perspective, they need three distinct capacities to continue delivering products, income and public goods: robustness, adaptability and transformability. Based on a structured assessment of the resilience capacities of 11 farming systems across Europe we conclude that three mismatches likely contribute to their struggles. First, while farming systems comprised many non-farm actors, resilience strategies largely focused on farms and their robustness, neglecting other options and opportunities. Second, while the delivery of public goods such as biodiversity and attractive landscapes was seen as a major concern, most resilience strategies focused on the delivery of private goods. Third, while in many farming systems actors expressed the need for transformation, farming systems’ capacity to transform was perceived as low. Building on the differentiated concept of resilience, findings can guide policymakers, farming system actors, consumers and societal interest groups to identify pathways towards more resilient agricultural systems in Europe. © 2020 The Authors.

Además de los productos diseñados para realizar inyecciones múltiples (normalmente de 3 a 5 inyecciones, en intervalos de 1 semana), se presta especial atención a los productos de una única inyección, ya que ofrecen ventajas específicas, como son un menor número de visitas al médico y de intervenciones invasivas con sus riesgos asociados. Sin embargo, aún existen dudas sobre la eficacia de estas inyecciones únicas, en comparación con los regímenes de inyecciones múltiples. Métodos: Se realizó un estudio multicéntrico, abierto, prospectivo, post-mercado (ART-ONE 75) con el producto de inyección única ARTHRUM 2,5% (3 ml, 75 mg AH), en 214 pacientes que sufrían de AR. Los pacientes fueron seguidos en D30, D60, D120 y D180 (días). El perfil promedio de los pacientes en el momento de la inclusión fue de 62,9 años, 56% mujeres, grados I-III de Kellgren-Lawrence (46% KL III), IMC de 27,2 kg/m2 y 4 años desde el diagnóstico de AR. Se realizó una comparación post-hoc con una inyección IA única de placebo (326 pacientes, agrupados de 3 estudios ECA), que proporcionaron un perfil de paciente similar. Resultados: el criterio principal fue la variación desde el inicio de la puntuación de la escala WOMAC A (dolor, escala 0-100) en D60, que se redujo en 28,9 (17,4) para la población por intención de tratar (ITT, por sus siglas en inglés) (199 pacientes), 28,0 (17,8) para la población por protocolo (PP) en la inclusión (175 pacientes), y en 27,7 (16,8) para la población PP al finalizar (143 pacientes). Los criterios secundarios y accesorios incluyeron WOMAC A en otras ocasiones, WOMAC B (rigidez), WOMAC C (función), calidad de vida y discapacidad en cada momento de seguimiento. Todos los índices mejoraron significativamente y continuaron mejorando al final del estudio. La evaluación terapéutica en D180 mostró que más del 75% de los pacientes se encontraban satisfechos con la reducción del dolor, la mejora de la movilidad, y la reducción de analgésicos y AINE. El porcentaje de pacientes definidos como respondedores de OMERACT-OARSI fue superior al 86%, a partir de D60 y en adelante. La tolerancia general fue buena, sin que ocurriera ningún evento adverso grave. El resultado de la comparación post-hoc para la escala WOMAC A mostró un tamaño del efecto [IC 95%] desde TE = 0,33 [0,15; 0,51] en D60 a TE = 0,65 [0,45; 0,85] en D180 (p <0,001), frente a la inyección de placebo (solución salina), lo cual es un resultado clínicamente relevante a favor de ARTHRUM 2,5%. Conclusión: El presente estudio confirma la eficacia clínica de una única inyección IA de 3 ml de solución de AH conteniendo 75 mg de AH nativo de alto PM (> 2 MDa). © 2019 The Authors","","Article; medical literature; priority journal","","Excerpta Medica Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065885927"

It is a consequence of the selective attention in perception that lets us remain focused on important parts of our world without distraction from irrelevant details. Motivated by selective attention, we study the properties of artificial agents that perceive the world through the lens of a self-attention bottleneck. By constraining access to only a small fraction of the visual input, we show that their policies are directly interpretable in pixel space. We find neuroevolution ideal for training self-attention architectures for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing us to incorporate modules that can include discrete, non-differentiable operations which are useful for our agent. We argue that self-attention has similar properties as indirect encoding, in the sense that large implicit weight matrices are generated from a small number of key-query parameters, thus enabling our agent to solve challenging vision based tasks with at least 1000x fewer parameters than existing methods. Since our agent attends to only task critical visual hints, they are able to generalize to environments where task irrelevant elements are modified while conventional methods fail.1 © 2020 Owner/Author.","","Computer science; Evolutionary algorithms; Artificial agents; Conventional methods; Inattentional blindness; Indirect encoding; Neuro evolutions; Non-differentiable; Selective attention; Through the lens; Reinforcement learning","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGEVO; Beacon; CINVESTAV-IPN; Uber","2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2020","8 July 2020 through 12 July 2020","Cancun","161512","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091784593"

Since the dimension of each FC in the parameter solution population changes with the generation of a new rule, a new solution update method is proposed in this paper. The data-driven interpretable fuzzy control approach is applied to control a nonlinear plant in simulation to verify its performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Data-driven fuzzy control; Evolutionary fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization","Constrained optimization; Cybernetics; Fuzzy control; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Control accuracy; Data driven; Evolutionary Fuzzy systems; Fuzzy controller design; Fuzzy controllers; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Objective functions; Solution population; Controllers","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2016","9 October 2016 through 12 October 2016","Budapest","126403","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015747939"

We evaluated differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients enrolled in Latin America compared with the rest of the world (RoW) in the TIOtropium Safety and Performance In Respimat® (TIOSPIR®) trial. Methods: TIOSPIR®, a 2–3-year, randomized, double-blind trial (n = 17 116; treated set), compared safety and efficacy of once-daily tiotropium Respimat® 5 and 2.5 μg with tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg. This post-hoc analysis pooled data from all treatment arms to assess mortality, exacerbations, cardiac events, and serious adverse events (SAEs) between both regions. Results: At baseline, patients enrolled in Latin America (n = 1000) versus RoW (n = 16 116) were older, with higher pack-years of smoking history and more exacerbations, but less cardiac history. In this analysis, patients in Latin America versus RoW had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.52 [1.24–1.86]; P <.0001) or moderate-to-severe exacerbation (HR [95% CI]: 1.29 [1.18–1.41]; P <.0001), but a lower risk of severe exacerbation (HR [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.68–0.98]; P =.0333). SAE rates in Latin America were lower versus RoW (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.72–0.92]), including cardiac disorders (IRR [95% CI]: 0.68 [0.48–0.97]). Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events were similar (HR [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.71–1.40]; P =.9677). Conclusions: TIOSPIR® patients in Latin America had a higher risk of death or moderate-to-severe exacerbation, but a lower risk of severe exacerbation than those in RoW.

However, whether the rate of tacrolimus metabolism affects outcomes between LCPT and IR-Tac was not examined. Patients were initiated on 0.17 mg/kg/day LCPT or 0.1 mg/kg/day IR-Tac, with doses adjusted over time to maintain target therapeutic trough concentrations. This post hoc analysis examined dosing trends, relative efficacy, and safety of LCPT (n=247) and IR-Tac (n=249) in slow, intermediate, and rapid metabolizers as defined by concentration/dose ratios at day 30. For all metabolizer subgroups, minimum target tacrolimus trough concentrations were obtained more rapidly with LCPT than with IR-Tac. Slow metabolizers were more likely to exceed target trough concentrations with LCPT, while rapid metabolizers were more likely to fall below target trough concentrations with IR-Tac. Regardless of metabolizer status, significant differences were not detected between LCPT and IR-Tac for treatment failure, death, graft failure, biopsy-proven acute rejection, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or other clinical outcomes. Although within metabolizer subgroups, attainment of target trough concentrations in the first week differed between LCPT and IR-Tac, these results suggest that, regardless of metabolizer phenotype, clinical outcomes do not differ between these formulations when dose adjustments are made. © International Scientific Information, Inc..

To date, such controllers have been constructed manually or trained automatically either using expert-generated problem-specific cost functions or incorporating detailed knowledge about the optimal control strategy. Both requirements for automatic training processes are not found in most real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems. In such applications, online learning is often prohibited for safety reasons because it requires exploration of the problem's dynamics during policy training. We introduce a fuzzy particle swarm reinforcement learning (FPSRL) approach that can construct fuzzy RL policies solely by training parameters on world models that simulate real system dynamics. These world models are created by employing an autonomous machine learning technique that uses previously generated transition samples of a real system. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to relate self-organizing fuzzy controllers to model-based batch RL. FPSRL is intended to solve problems in domains where online learning is prohibited, system dynamics are relatively easy to model from previously generated default policy transition samples, and it is expected that a relatively easily interpretable control policy exists. The efficiency of the proposed approach with problems from such domains is demonstrated using three standard RL benchmarks, i.e., mountain car, cart-pole balancing, and cart-pole swing-up. Our experimental results demonstrate high-performing, interpretable fuzzy policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy controller; Fuzzy policy; Interpretable; Particle swarm optimization; Reinforcement learning","Controllers; Cost functions; E-learning; Learning systems; Optimal control systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Poles; Problem solving; Swarm intelligence; System theory; Autonomous machines; Fuzzy controllers; Fuzzy particle swarm; Fuzzy reinforcement learning; Interpretable; Optimal control strategy; Self-organizing fuzzy controllers; Training parameters; Reinforcement learning","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029956200"

Our method must be flexible to adapt to very different problems. Therefore, it has to be able to work with or without the influence of prior data and knowledge. Moreover, regardless of the success, it should be as interpretable as possible to allow for diagnosis and improvement. We propose here a new open source generation method using an evolutionary algorithm to sequentially build molecular graphs. It is independent of starting data and can generate totally unseen compounds. To be able to search a large part of the chemical space, we define an original set of 7 generic mutations close to the atomic level. Our method achieves excellent performances and even records on the QED, penalised logP, SAscore, CLscore as well as the set of goal-directed functions defined in GuacaMol. To demonstrate its flexibility, we tackle a very different objective issued from the organic molecular materials domain. We show that EvoMol can generate sets of optimised molecules having high energy HOMO or low energy LUMO, starting only from methane. We can also set constraints on a synthesizability score and structural features. Finally, the interpretability of EvoMol allows for the visualisation of its exploration process as a chemically relevant tree.

We use the Spanish sample (192 schools and 3339 teachers) participating in the 2013 edition of TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Study), sponsored by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Employing hierarchical linear models, we assess the importance of teacher variables and schools variables as predictors of job satisfaction. Self-efficacy, control of classroom discipline, age, sex, years of work experience at the current school and employment status are personal factors explaining the teacher job satisfaction.

Among others, the criteria of model distinguishability, completeness, compactness, and fuzzy set sharing between rules are considered. To support distinguishability, the distances between fuzzy set centers are lower bounded and the widths are manipulated as to control the overlap between fuzzy sets. Sufficient conditions are given to satisfy the completeness criterion, whereas the compactness requirement is addressed by comparing models with different number of rules. Finally, fuzzy set sharing between rules is achieved through a model optimization procedure that involves fuzzy set merging. It turns out that the feasible region is a compact and convex set. The tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy is established by minimizing the model's square error over the feasible region through constrained particle swarm optimization. The method is tested using a number of high-dimensional datasets and conducting two kinds of experiments. The first focuses on interpretability. The second studies the accuracy by comparing the method to other algorithms that perform unconstrained optimization, using nonparametric statistics. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Constrained optimization; fuzzy modeling; interpretability; nonparametric statistics; particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy sets; Merging; Models; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Set theory; Statistics; Constrained particle swarm optimization; Fuzzy modeling; Indexes; Interpretability; Interpretability and accuracy; Interpretability constraints; Linear inequality constraints; Non-parametric statistics; Constrained optimization","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035128624"

Methods The questionnaire included 4 blocks of questions concerning dyslipidaemic patients with impaired carbohydrate metabolism. This study presents the results of the impact of CKD on screening and the choice of statin. Results Of the 497 experts included, 58% were PCPs and 42% were specialists (35, 7% were nephrologists). There was consensus by both PCPs and specialists, with no difference between PCPs and specialists, that CKD patients should undergo a dyslipidaemia screening and that the screening should be part of routine clinical practice. However, there was no consensus in considering the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (although there was consensus among PCPs and nephrologists), or considering albuminuria when selecting a statin, or in determining albuminuria during follow-up after having initiated treatment with statins (although there was consensus among the nephrologists). Conclusions The consensus to analyse the lipid profile in CKD patients suggests acknowledgment of the high cardiovascular risk of this condition. However, the lack of consensus in considering renal function or albuminuria, both when selecting a statin and during follow-up, suggests a limited knowledge of the differences between statins in relation to CKD. Thus, it would be advisable to develop a guideline/consensus document on the use of statins in CKD. © 2016 Sociedad Española de Nefrología","Cardiovascular risk; Chronic kidney disease; Dyslipidaemia; Statins","Albuminuria; Cardiovascular Diseases; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Dyslipidemias; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Lipids; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; albuminuria; Article; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney disease; clinical practice; consensus; controlled study; disease association; dyslipidemia; estimated glomerular filtration rate; follow up; general practitioner; human; kidney function; lipid analysis; major clinical study; medical specialist; nephrologist; post hoc analysis; questionnaire; screening test; albuminuria; chronic kidney failure; Delphi study; diagnostic test; dyslipidemia; medical care; screening; blood; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; complication; dyslipidemia; glomerulus filtration rate; risk factor","","Elsevier Espana S.L.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045291277"

The multi-view methodology has widely been used for semi-supervised learning, where just some patterns were previously classified by an expert and there is a large amount of unlabelled ones. However to our knowledge, the multi-view learning paradigm has not been applied to produce interpretable rule-based classifiers before. In this work, we present a multi-view extension of a grammar-based genetic programming model for inducing rules for semi-supervised contexts. Its idea is to evolve several populations, and their corresponding views, favouring both the accuracy of the predictions for the labelled patterns and the prediction agreement with the other views for unlabelled ones. We have carried out experiments with two to five views, on six common datasets for fully-supervised learning that have been partially anonymised for our semi-supervised study. Our results show that the multi-view paradigm allows to obtain slightly better rule-based classifiers, and that two views becomes preferred. © 2017 IEEE.","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2017","5 June 2017 through 8 June 2017","Donostia-San Sebastian","129053","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027874040"

This organic compound has particular properties that may cause effects on soils depending on its feedstock and processing conditions. Thus, the characteristics and purpose of use of this material must be recognized prior to its use. Two types of biochar, derived from different wood sources, were compared, one from caatinga biome species and another from cashew trees. Two species from caatinga biome were used, jurema-preta (Mimosa tenuiflora Willd. Poir.), and marmeleiro (Croton sonderianus Müll. Arg.). This study aimed to identify the best biochar material regionally available to increase water-holding capacity in the soil, based on laboratory tests and microstructural porosity evaluation. Biochar from Caatinga wood demonstrated an improved water-holding capacity if compared to cashew wood biochar. The particle diameters of 2 and 4 mm showed the highest levels, which were 2,268 g.g                             -1                              for caatinga wood and 0.574 g.g                             -1                              for cashew wood biochars, respectively. While the smaller quantities of macropores and a larger number of micropores (smaller radius) could explain the higher water-holding capacity for biochar from caatinga wood, the thick lignified cell walls of biochar from cashew wood support the idea of a hydrophobic effect contributing to water lower holding capacity.                          © 2018, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid.

This leads to a growing interest throughout many communities; where do algorithms and trained models break? Recently, methods such as generative adversarial neural networks and variational autoencoders were proposed to create adversarial examples that challenge algorithms. This results in artificial intelligence having higher false detections or completely losing recognition. The problem is that existing solutions, are for the most part, black boxes. Current gaps include how do we better control and understand adversarial algorithms. Herein, we propose the concept of an adversarial modifier set as an understandable and controlled way to generate adversarial examples. This is achieved by exploiting the improved evolution-constructed algorithm to identify ideal features that a victim algorithm values in imagery. These features are combined to realize a tuple library that preserves spatial relations.

Evaluating the extracted features based on the combination of accuracy measures and visualization measures can help to achieve the two objectives simultaneously. However, the exploitation of improper visualization measures and combination methods will decrease the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method based on GP and non-overlap degree is proposed to extract interpretable features for high accuracy and visualization. And a novel function that maximizes the product of the accuracy of a linear classifier and the non-overlap degree is proposed to evaluate the extracted features. The proposed method, named GP-ANO, is compared with other methods on five medical datasets by six common machine learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the GP-ANO method outperforms other compared methods in terms of both classification accuracy and data visualization. © 2020 IEEE.","data visualization; feature extraction; genetic programming; interpretation; non-overlap degree","Bioinformatics; Data visualization; Extraction; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning systems; Magnetic disk storage; Visualization; Accuracy measures; Classification accuracy; Combination method; Feature extraction methods; Linear classifiers; Machine learning methods; Medical data sets; Novel functions; Classification (of information)","Park T.; Cho Y.-R.; Hu X.T.; Yoo I.; Woo H.G.; Wang J.; Facelli J.; Nam S.; Kang M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bio-Synergy Research Center (BSRC); Korea Genome Open HRD (K-GENOME); Korea Genome Organization (KOGO); Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies (KOFST); Seoul National University; Seoul National University (SNU) Bioinformatics Institute","2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, BIBM 2020","16 December 2020 through 19 December 2020","Virtual, Seoul","166496","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100349017"

Method: Cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from the Spanish National Health Survey (2012), and HRQOL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (utility and visual analogue scale –VAS– scores). Demographic variables, physical health condition, social variables, mental health status, and lifestyle were also analysed. Tobit regression models were employed to study the relationships between expressed HRQOL and personal characteristics. Results: A total of 20,979 surveys were obtained. Of them, 62.4% expressed a utility score of 1, corresponding to perfect health (95%CI: 61.8%–63.2%), and 54.2% showed VAS scores ≥80 (95%CI: 53.5%–54.9%). HRQOL was mainly described as a function of age, chronic limitation in daily activities, and mental health status. Belonging to a higher-class strata and physical activity were related to better self-perceived HRQOL. Ageing worsened perceived HRQOL, but did not influence its determinants, and differences in HRQOL by regions were also not significant after model adjustment. Conclusion: HRQOL perception in the Spanish population varied slightly depending on the measure used (utilities index or VAS). Age, chronic limitations in daily life, and mental health status best explained the variability in perception, and no meaningful differences in HRQOL perception among regions were found after adjustment. © 2017 SESPAS","Health status; Population characteristics; Public health; Quality of life","Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Style; Male; Medically Underserved Area; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Quality of Life; Social Class; Social Determinants of Health; Spain; aging; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; health status; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; mental health; perception; physical activity; public health; quality of life; questionnaire; Spaniard; visual analog scale; female; health care planning; health status; health survey; male; middle aged; social class; social determinants of health; Spain; theoretical model","","Ediciones Doyma, S.L.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029894942"

The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to argue that the ontological dimension of the debate cannot be ignored; second, to claim that taking ontology into account involves considering a third perspective on the relation between spacetime and symmetries of laws; one in which both terms would be somehow derived from common assumptions on the formulation of a given physical theory. © 2020 Upv/Ehu.","Dynamical approach; Dynamical Symmetries; Explanation; Minkowski spacetime; Spacetime Symmetries; Special Relativity","","","Universidad del Pais Vasco","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091284066"

The study was conducted with students at the city of Apucarana, Parana, Brazil. Initially, a lecture with a multimedia kit on the subject was presented, after it was shown and discussed some packets of biscuits originally from main market where trans fats were emphasized. Then groups of 4 people were formed to play the board game with cards. The explanation of the information “0% trans” is not zero, but up to 0.2 g of trans fat per portion was particularly important for students who showed in a biscuit brand where eating three units could get to have up to 30 g. The finding that eating three units accounted for 10% of the recommended total, the package containing 200g is 67% of the total recommended it was enough, in general, to alert the students, especially those who eat an entire package along the day. The game proved its importance increasing the debate and encouraging students to enhance learning. In addition, the project was able to explain, eye-catching advertising, teach and open the horizons of students. © 2017, Foundation Journal of Science Education.

Generative models have tremendously increased efficiency of de novo design of drug molecules. This paper proposes to use self-attention mechanism to generate novel molecules through language modeling. Language modeling enables the generated molecules to have properties similar to the molecules present in the training set. Self-attention enables the model to identify the relevant context between the various elements generated in the molecular sequence. This takes care of the dependencies involved in molecular structures. In this generative approach, the molecules are represented using formal molecule notation known as SMILES and the Transformer-XL architecture is used for training and sampling of novel molecules.

Methods: A post hoc analysis was performed on a prospective, multicenter cohort of patients with BSI-E initially treated with ertapenem or antipseudomonal β-lactams. Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with early de-escalation (EDE) and Cox regression for the impact of EDE and late de-escalation (LDE) on 30-day all-cause mortality. A propensity score (PS) for EDE vs no de-escalation (NDE) was calculated. Failure at end of treatment and length of hospital stay were also analyzed. Results: Overall, 516 patients were included. EDE was performed in 241 patients (46%), LDE in 95 (18%), and NDE in 180 (35%). Variables independently associated with a lower probability of EDE were multidrug-resistant isolates (odds ratio [OR], 0.50 [95% confidence interval {CI},. 30-.83]) and nosocomial infection empirically treated with imipenem or meropenem (OR, 0.35 [95% CI,. 14-.87]). After controlling for confounders, EDE was not associated with increased risk of mortality; hazard ratios (HR) (95% CIs) were as follows: general model, 0.58 (.25-1.31); model with PS, 0.69 (.29-1.65); and PS-based matched pairs, 0.98 (.76-1.26). LDE was not associated with mortality. De-escalation was not associated with clinical failure or length of hospital stay. Conclusions: De-escalation in patients with monomicrobial bacteremia due to Enterobacteriaceae was not associated with a detrimental impact on clinical outcome. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

While some authors have adopted a macro level approach to explain this success highlighting the relevance of the context of crisis, others have focused on micro explanations to analyse how the ""losers of globalization"" (the elderly, less educated and lower class) comprise the main electoral base of these parties. However, RWPP have performed much better in countries less affected by the crisis and, in certain contexts, the so-called ""losers"" of globalization have not been their main electoral base. Using individual data for 12 Western European countries provided by the European Election Studies (2014) database, in this paper we demonstrate that the combination of these two sets of explanations (at the macro and micro levels) is necessary not only for empirical reasons, but also for conceptual ones to understand the phenomenon. While the general profile of this family of voters tend to be older, less educated and belonging to the lower class, in countries most affected by the crisis RWPP voters tend to be younger and better educated. © 2018, Asociacion Espanola de Ciencia Politica y de la Administracion.","Comportamiento electoral; Electoral behavior; Gran Recesión; Great Recession; Immigration; Inmigración; Partidos populistas de derecha; Populismo; Populist parties; Right-wing populism","","","Asociacion Espanola de Ciencia Politica y de la Administracion","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059042123"

In the standard books such as ‘Concise Inorganic Chemistry’ by J. D. Lee and ‘Theoretical Inorganic Chemistry’ by Marion Clyde Jr. Day and Joel Selbin, they have explained the splitting of d-orbitals in octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar etc., complexes very well. The same is the case with the latest pre-university NCERT chemistry textbook (Volume I) written for the Indian audience. The reason why the energy levels of certain d-orbitals are above the barycenter and why some are below the barycenter, however, is not explained explicitly in any of the books (including the latest books). This short communication outlines a simple rule of thumb that allows this phenomenon to be explained to students. Further, an important graph in the standard books is plotted, but the trend of the curve is not explained.

Fuzzy controllers have been used in industry for decades as interpretable and efficient system controllers. In this study, we introduce a fuzzy genetic programming (GP) approach called fuzzy GP reinforcement learning (FGPRL) that can select the relevant state features, determine the size of the required fuzzy rule set, and automatically adjust all the controller parameters simultaneously. Each GP individual's fitness is computed using model-based batch reinforcement learning (RL), which first trains a model using available system samples and subsequently performs Monte Carlo rollouts to predict each policy candidate's performance. We compare FGPRL to an extended version of a related method called fuzzy particle swarm reinforcement learning (FPSRL), which uses swarm intelligence to tune the fuzzy policy parameters. Exper¬ iments using an industrial benchmark show that FGPRL is able to autonomously learn interpretable fuzzy policies w i t h high control performance. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

These semantics are intensional, hence they predict that logically equivalent clauses can be substituted in counterfactuals salva veritate. A recent truth-value judgment study by Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion ([6]; CZC) appears to challenge both the idea that com-parative similarity plays a role in counterfactual semantics and the prediction that logical equivalents are substitutable. CZC account for their data via an inquisitive semantics for disjunction and a semantics for counterfactuals that does not exploit the standard similar-ity algorithm. We report on a study consisting of two experiments that start from CZC's general idea, but use a simpler scenario, manipulate negation more systematically, and add an extra task based on the selection of pictures. Our results replicate the differences found by CZC, but they also suggest that the effect is linked to the presence of overt negation rather than disjunction. We conclude that (i) inquisitive disjunction is neither necessary nor sufficient to account for the problem in full generality, and (ii) the evidence does not encourage rejecting a similarity semantics. © 2019 Proceedings of the 22nd Amsterdam Colloquium, AC 2019.

The method generates a noise set located in the neighborhood of the point of interest, whose prediction should be explained, and fits a local explanation model for the analyzed sample. The tree structure generated by GPX provides a comprehensible analytical, possibly non-linear, expression which reflects the local behavior of the complex model. We considered three machine learning techniques that can be recognized as complex black-box models: Random Forest, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine in twenty data sets for regression and classifications problems. Our results indicate that the GPX is able to produce more accurate understanding of complex models than the state of the art.

This phenomenon is primarily caused by oilfield wastewater disposal into deep geologic formations, which induces fluid pressure transients that decrease effective stress and trigger earthquakes on critically stressed faults. It is now generally accepted that the cumulative effects of multiple injection wells may result in fluid pressure transients migrating 20–40 km from well clusters. However, one recent study found that oilfield wastewater volume and earthquake occurrence are spatially cross-correlated at length-scales exceeding 100 km across Oklahoma. Moreover, researchers recently reported observations of increasing fluid pressure in wells located ~90 km north of the regionally expansive oilfield wastewater disposal operations at the Oklahoma-Kansas border. Thus, injection-induced fluid pressure transients may travel much longer distances than previously considered possible. This study utilizes numerical simulation to demonstrate how the hydrogeologic principle of superposition reasonably explains the occurrence of long-range pressure transients during oilfield wastewater disposal. The principle of superposition states that the cumulative effects of multiple pumping wells are additive and results from this study show that just nine high-rate injection wells drives a 10-kPa pressure front to radial distances exceeding 70 km after 10 years, regardless of basement permeability. These results yield compelling evidence that superposition is a plausible mechanistic process to explain long-range pressure accumulation and earthquake-triggering in Oklahoma and Kansas. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Earthquake; Injection wells; Numerical modeling; Salt water disposal; Wastewater","Oklahoma [Oklahoma (STT)]; Oklahoma [United States]; United States; earthquake event; fluid injection; numerical model; oil field; salt water; wastewater treatment","","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075920373"

The results also reaffirm the potential of social network analysis in assessing the relationship between agricultural production and sustainability in rural regions with mixed socio-economic systems. © 2020, CEDDAR.

Based on the literature of information disclosure, this paper analyses factors that influenced the freedom of information in Spanish municipalities, and which explain the levels of information disclosure. For the purpose of this study, a dynamic panel System General Method of Moments (System-GMM) estimation was used to analyses data from 100 Spanish largest municipalities for the period of 2008-2014. Additionally, the sample was partitioned in two categories according to the province capital or not province capital criteria in order to find if there are interesting differences. The analysis indicates that disclosure of information about municipal management is associated with financial dependence, internet access, unemployment, electoral turnout and political rivalry. Differences found in the two categories of municipalities suggest that there may be institutional characteristics that could influence the dissemination of information. This study is a contribution to the growing body literature of information disclosure in order to understand what explains the variations of information disclosure among the municipalities. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.

I draw attention to how anti-violence organizations working in marginalized communities theorize these complexities, and practices of what I am calling ‘plural resistance,’ which these organizations enact through equally complex responses to such violences. Plural resistance describes community-based strategies that simultaneously reject both gender violence and other forms of systemic violence, such as poverty born of uneven development.

However, its relevance to advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not yet been studied. In the present study we investigated the AST/ALT ratio as a possible predictor of treatment response and disease outcome in patients with advanced PDAC treated with first-line gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Methods: A post hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter, noninterventional study was performed. A total of 202 patients with advanced PDAC treated with first-line gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for whom the AST/ALT ratio was measured were included in this analysis. Results: Median and 1-year progression-free survival estimates were 4.8 months and 5.1%, respectively in patients with an AST/ALT ratio above the 75th percentile of its distribution, and 6.0 months and 18.7%, respectively in patients with an AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to this cutoff, respectively (log-rank p = 0.004). In univariable Cox regression, a doubling of the AST/ALT ratio was associated with a 1.4-fold higher relative risk of progression or death [hazard ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–1.80, p = 0.017]. The prognostic association was also found in multivariable analysis adjusting for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and lung metastases (hazard ratio per AST/ALT ratio doubling = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00–1.75, p = 0.047). In treatment response analysis, a doubling of the AST/ALT ratio was associated with a 0.5-fold lower odds of objective response (odds ratio = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31–0.94, p = 0.020). Conclusions: The pretreatment serum AST/ALT ratio predicts poor disease outcome and response rate in patients with advanced PDAC treated with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and might represent a novel and inexpensive marker for individual risk assessment in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. © The Author(s), 2020.","AST/ALT; biomarker; De Ritis ratio; gemcitabine; nab-paclitaxel; pancreatic cancer; treatment response","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; CA 19-9 antigen; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; tumor marker; abnormally high substrate concentration in blood; aged; Article; blood level; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer regression; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical decision making; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine clearance; disease association; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; lymph node metastasis; male; metastasis; multicenter study; objective response rate; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; peritoneum metastasis; phase 4 clinical trial; post hoc analysis; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; radiography; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; treatment response","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083109761"

As a first step towards adding explanations to business process, we present an exploratory study to merge the concept of explainability and business processes, and we propose a conceptual framework to use explainability with business process in a model that we called the Explainable Business Process (XBP). Furthermore, we propose an XBP lifecycle, based on the Model-based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering (MIKE) approach, in order to show in details the phase where explainability fits in the business process lifecycle, noting that we focus on explaining the decisions and activities of the process in its as-is model, without transforming it into a to-be model.

Attempts to historically contextualise such a seemingly anomalous distribution have, we believe, been undermined by a simplistic reading of the his-toriography, leading to the marginalisation of any early-medieval explanation for these re-sults, in favour of other more historically ten-uous alternatives. Accordingly, these studies have been largely ignored by medievalists, further exacerbating a lack of dialogue between disciplines. We suggest that the per-ceived paradox between length of political control and genetic legacy should be used to challenge the orthodoxy surrounding events in the eighth century, and thus explore the possi-bility of a more profound Berber influence on northwest Iberia than has hitherto been con-templated, rather than being marginalised by historians interested in said period. © 2020 CSIC.","Berbers; Genetics; Middle Ages; North Africa; Northwest Iberia","","","CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101285340"

Many quantitative analysts have used machine learning-based methods tofi nd unknown profitable market rules from large amounts of market data. However, there are several challenges infi nancial markets hindering practical applications of machine learning-based models. First, infi nancial markets, there is no single model that can consistently make accurate prediction because traders in markets quickly adapt to newly available information. Instead, there are a number of ephemeral and partially correct models called “alpha factors”. Second, sincefi nancial markets are highly uncertain, ensuring interpretability of prediction models is quite important to make reliable trading strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Trader-Company method, a novel evolutionary model that mimics the roles of afi nancial institute and traders belonging to it. Our method predicts future stock returns by aggregating suggestions from multiple weak learners called Traders. A Trader holds a collection of simple mathematical formulae, each of which represents a candidate of an alpha factor and would be interpretable for real-world investors. The aggregation algorithm, called a Company, maintains multiple Traders. By randomly generating new Traders and retraining them, Companies can efficiently findfi nancially meaningful formulae whilst avoiding overfitting to a transient state of the market. We show the effectiveness of our method by conducting experiments on real market data. © 2021 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

In BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT, kidney-transplant recipients were randomized to receive belatacept more intense (MI)–based, belatacept less intense (LI)–based, or cyclosporine-based immunosuppression for up to 7 years (84 months). The presence/absence of HLA-specific antibodies was determined at baseline, at months 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 84, and at the time of clinically suspected episodes of acute rejection, using solid-phase flow-cytometry screening. Samples from anti-HLA-positive patients were further tested with a single-antigen bead assay to determine antibody specificities, presence/absence of DSAs, and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of any DSAs present. In BENEFIT, de novo DSAs developed in 1.4%, 3.5%, and 12.1% of belatacept MI-treated, belatacept LI-treated, and cyclosporine-treated patients, respectively. The corresponding values in BENEFIT-EXT were 3.8%, 1.1%, and 11.2%. Per Kaplan-Meier analysis, de novo DSA incidence was significantly lower in belatacept-treated vs cyclosporine-treated patients over 7 years in both studies (P <.01). In patients who developed de novo DSAs, belatacept-based immunosuppression was associated with numerically lower MFI vs cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. Although derived post hoc, these data suggest that belatacept-based immunosuppression suppresses de novo DSA development more effectively than cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. © 2018 The Authors.

Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proved to be effective. However, the numerical representation of dialog policy is human-incomprehensible and difficult for dialog system designers to verify or modify, which limits its practical application. In this paper we propose a novel framework for optimizing dialog policies specified in domain language using genetic algorithm. The human-interpretable representation of policy makes the method suitable for practical employment. We present learning algorithms using user simulation and real human-machine dialogs respectively.

Therefore, to encourage energy efficiency it is important to know which non-financial factors influence energy use. Numerous evidences suggest that the Value- Belief-Norm model (VBN) is an adequate framework to understand this behaviour. However, few studies tested VBN to predict energy efficiency behaviour and even fewer did so in Latin America. Our aim was to test whether a VBN model was successful for predicting household energy efficiency behaviours among Argentinian citizens (n = 275). Results showed that the VBN model indeed explained self-reported energy efficiency. Importantly, a VBN model version assessed by means of a path analysis showed a good fit to the data. Biospheric values and personal norms were particularly strong predictors of household energy efficiency. These results indicate that personal norms, activated by values, are able to predict energy efficiency actions in an Argentinean sample. These evidences suggest that moral considerations should be promoted in order to increase energy efficiency actions in Argentina. © 2016 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Household energy use; Value-belief-norm model","","","Routledge","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052236800"

Knowing history (names, dates, places, processes...) is no guarantee for fostering historical thinking, which supposes, among other things, strengthening the idea of causality (the explanatory complexity of a fact), which is, perforce, linked to the idea of historical relevance, i.e. who and what deserves to be studied and what implications they have had for events. This paper aims to look more deeply at the historical knowledge of students (specifically, here, their knowledge of the Middle Ages) and the level of their thinking skills by analyzing historical explanations. It therefore focuses on the causes and consequences that the student develops for a supposed and fictitious given by analyzing the students’ own narratives. We carried out a qualitative study of a phenomenological design. The participants were 66 primary school children from 5 and 6 at two state schools in Murcia (SE Spain). The data collection protocol was evaluated by peer experts. These narratives were analyzed following an deductive-inductive procedure backed up with the software ATLAS.ti (version 6.2.28). While the research is subject to important limitations, such as the small sample size, the lack of sincerity or the risks inherent to qualitative methodologies, we do believe that the findings reveal a simple identification of the causeconsequence relationship regardless of the historical context as an explanatory element of the actions. Fostering the learning of history through narratives may help to offset these deficiencies2. © 2016, Ministry Education and Science.

We retrospectively reviewed all AE and serious AE (SAE) in The Scandinavian heart transplant (HTx) everolimus (EVE) de novo trial with early calcineurin (CNI) avoidance (SCHEDULE). The aim of the study was to compare wound complications between EVE and CNI based regimen. Materials and methods A total of 115 patients (mean age 51 ± 13 years, 73% men) were randomized within five days post-HTx to low dose EVE and reduced dose Cyclosporine (CyA) followed by early CyA withdrawal (EVE group; n = 56) or standard CyA regimen (CyA group; n = 59). All AE/SAEs were prospectively recorded according to the SCHEDULE study protocol, and re-assessed retrospectively by two independent reviewers. Wound complication as primary endpoint was defined as any complication associated with failure of tissue healing. Secondary endpoint was total number of events involving surgical intervention. Results There were no significant differences between the groups with regards to wound complications (EVE = 20, CyA = 12)(p = 0.08) or total surgical events (EVE = 38, CyA = 34) (p = 0.44). Age > 54.5 years (median) was an overall risk factor for surgical wound complications regardless of treatment group (p = 0.025). There was no difference in the EVE versus CyA group with regards to other surgical events. Majority of events were in 1/3 of the patients. Conclusion De novo initiation of EVE and early CyA withdrawal in HTx patients did not show any significant differences in wound complications or in total surgical events. Majority of complications were seen in a small number of patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this article, it is argued that one should not assimilate the Action Based Scheme solely to Methodological Individualism even though this tradition has received much credit. One key issue here is the status of cognition within explanation frames. More precisely, one should introduce within the explanation frames several types of cognitive states. It will be argued that there is a conceptual compatibility between the Action Based Scheme and the interactionist sociology that was proposed in the 1950s and 1960s. This theoretical exploration will focus on Peter Berger&#39;s theory of secularization as developed in The Sacred Canopy. It will be claimed that Berger has not only proposed an explanation that brings up cognitive states, he also refers to cognitive states of a modest nature, more modest than those Methodological Individualism usually considers. © The Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion.","","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962385802"

Moroccan youth reported higher levels of both past civic engagement and future intentions than Albanian and Italian peers. Perceived effectiveness of civic engagement and past experience are consistently associated with stronger intentions to engage in the future (offline and online) in all groups.

This paper surveys the most compelling arguments regarding these frameworks: (1) the approach 'CT as a language skill'; (2) those who claim that pretending shows that children have CT; (3) those who consider pretend play is a rehearsal for cognitive dispositions. I shall point out that the three approaches on CT are incomplete: (1) neglects pretend play (which prelinguistic children perform) as an instantiation of the CT; (2) puts too much emphasis on the linguistic dimension of pretense; (3) is highly demanding on the cognitive architecture that we ought to have by nature-the socalled children as scientists. © 2016 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Bayesian learning; causal learning; cognitive development; Counterfactual reasoning; interventionism","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961181128"
