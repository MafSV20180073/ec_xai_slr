This paper aims to take on the stance detection task by placing the emphasis not so much on the text itself but on the interaction data available on social networks. More specifically, we propose a new method to leverage social information such as friends and retweets by generating Relational Embeddings, namely, dense vector representations of interaction pairs. Our experiments on seven publicly available datasets and four different languages (Basque, Catalan, Italian, and Spanish) show that combining our relational embeddings with discriminative textual methods helps to substantially improve performance, obtaining state-of-the-art results for six out of seven evaluation settings, outperforming strong baselines based on Large Language Models, or other popular interaction-based approaches such as DeepWalk or node2vec. ©2025 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.","Interactions; Large Language Models; Multilinguality; Natural Language Processing; Social Networks; Stance Detection","","Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural","","","","","","11355948","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001988788"

A critical factor affecting the effectiveness of this strengthening method is the bond behavior between Fe-SMA and parent structures. However, due to the multitude of influencing factors, especially the effect of long-term hygrothermal environments, predicting bond strength is complex and time-consuming. In light of these challenges, machine learning (ML) offers an efficient scheme for predicting bond strength. This study uses explainable ML models to predict the bond strength of Fe-SMA/steel single joints (SJs). The performance of Spearman-based, importance-based, and norm-based feature selection methods is investigated to identify the most representative feature combinations. Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO), and African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) are employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of random forest (RF) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). Additionally, the best-performing model is interpreted utilizing Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP). The results demonstrate that GTO and SSA enhance the performance of RF and BPNN to the greatest extent, respectively. Compared to unoptimized algorithms, the prediction accuracy of GTO-RF and SSA-BPNN gets improved by 29.98 % and 44.15 %, respectively. Guaranteeing the quality of adhesives is essential for the mechanical performance of Fe-SMA-bonded strengthening structures, given the strong correlation between adhesive property and bond strength. Feature dependence analysis identifies that the effective length of SJs approaches 125 mm. This study offers valuable and innovative solutions for improving the quality and efficiency of Fe-SMA-bonded strengthening design for building maintenance. Its primary advantage lies in the integration of multiple optimization algorithms and explainable ML techniques. These approaches not only improve prediction accuracy but also enhance model interpretability, providing more reliable guidance for practical engineering applications. © 2025 Institution of Structural Engineers","Back-propagation neural network; Bond strength; Fe-SMA/steel single joint; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Random forest; Shapley additive explanation","Model structures; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring; Back-propagation neural networks; Bond strength; Fe-SMA/steel single joint; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Machine learning models; Optimizers; Random forests; Search Algorithms; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Bond strength (materials)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23520124","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007599089"

However, solving the Vehicle and Multi-Drone Cooperative Delivery Problem with Delivery Restrictions is challenging due to complex constraints, including limited payloads, short endurance, regional restrictions, and multi-objective optimization. Traditional optimization methods, particularly genetic algorithms, struggle to address these complexities, often relying on static rules or single-objective optimization that fails to balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in local optima and slow convergence. The concept of symmetry plays a crucial role in optimizing the scheduling process, as many logistics problems inherently possess symmetrical properties. By exploiting these symmetries, we can reduce the problem’s complexity and improve solution efficiency. This study proposes a novel and scalable scheduling approach to address the Vehicle and Multi-Drone Cooperative Delivery Problem with Delivery Restrictions, tackling its high complexity, constraint handling, and real-world applicability. Specifically, we propose a logistics scheduling method called Loegised, which integrates large language models with genetic algorithms while incorporating symmetry principles to enhance the optimization process. Loegised includes three innovative modules: a cognitive initialization module to accelerate convergence by generating high-quality initial solutions, a dynamic operator parameter adjustment module to optimize crossover and mutation rates in real-time for better global search, and a local optimum escape mechanism to prevent stagnation and improve solution diversity. The experimental results on benchmark datasets show that Loegised achieves an average delivery time of 14.80, significantly outperforming six state-of-the-art baseline methods, with improvements confirmed by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests ((Formula presented.)). In large-scale scenarios, Loegised reduces delivery time by over 20% compared to conventional methods, demonstrating strong scalability and practical applicability. These findings validate the effectiveness and real-world potential of symmetry-enhanced, language model-guided optimization for advanced logistics scheduling. © 2025 by the authors.","dynamic constraints; genetic algorithm; large language models; logistics scheduling; multi-drone cooperative delivery; optimization algorithm","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20738994","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009141413"

However, optimization processes must treat various systems theory concepts, such as stability and controllability, differently, as swarm optimization relies on preserving diversity rather than reaching uniform agent behavior. This work addresses this duality of perspective and proposes State-Space Particle Swarm Optimization (SS-PSO) using the feedback concept in control systems theory. By exploiting the hidden analogy between these two paradigms, we introduce the concept of controllability for optimization purposes through state-space representation. Extending controllability to particle swarm optimization (PSO) highlights the ability to span the search space, emphasizing the significance of particles' movement rather than their loss of diversity. Furthermore, adaptive exploration (AE) using an iterative bisection algorithm is proposed for the PSO parameters that leverages this controllability measure and its minimum singular value to facilitate explainable swarm behaviors and escape local minima. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that SS-PSO is only uncontrollable when the cognitive factor is zero, implying less exploration. Finally, AE enhances exploration by increasing the controllability matrix's minimum singular value. This result underscores the profound connection between the controllability matrix and exploration, a critical insight that significantly enhances our understanding of swarm optimization. AE-based State-Space-PSO (AESS-PSO) shows improved exploration and performance over PSO in 86 SOP and CEC benchmarks, particularly for smaller populations. © 2025","Adaptive exploration; Controllability; Particle swarm optimization; State feedback control; Theoretical framework","Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive control systems; Benchmarking; Feedback control; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); State feedback; Swarm intelligence; System theory; Adaptive explorations; Minimum singular value; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; State feedback control; State-space; Swarm behavior; Swarm optimization; Theoretical framework; Controllability","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219118414"

Causal reasoning, particularly at Pearl’s interventional and counterfactual levels, is critical for achieving true general intelligence. In this study, we propose a causal reasoning framework that includes a three-axis taxonomy for causality, designed to capture the intent, action requirements, and the three rungs of causality as defined by Pearl: associational, interventional, and counterfactual; and a human-in-the-loop approach to generate golden collections of natural causal questions, annotated according to the proposal taxonomy. We evaluated the seed questions of a golden collection in Portuguese using the LLM GPT-4o and Llama3.1 with two prompt strategies.

Prediction of gas holdup assumes importance in the design of airlift contactor. The key challenge in prediction of gas holdup is due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable phenomenological models. The improved prediction accuracies can provide better contactor design and equipment performance. The current work focuses on the use of data driven models for prediction of gas holdup, as the existing empirical correlations were found to be inadequate. In this work, 324 data points from the reported works on internal draft airlift contactor are consolidated. The input part of the examples in the data set consists of ten features which are related to geometry, fluid properties and operating conditions. This study improves the predictive accuracy of gas holdup, the output variable, in ILACs using a Random Forest (RF) model optimized via Genetic Algorithms (GA).

Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, our approach integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM’s quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate our approach in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.

Not only can software defects lead to system failure, but they can also have serious economic and social consequences. Most of the current methods rely on a single type of feature and fail to explore the multiple information in the code fully. Meanwhile, manually tuning hyperparameters is both time-consuming and difficult to achieve optimal results. Based on the encoder architecture, this research proposes an enhanced software defect prediction model, which combines the self-attention mechanism and particle swarm optimization (PSO-BiEncoders-SelfAttn). This model achieves efficient feature extraction, dynamic adjustment of feature fusion weights, and automated optimization of hyperparameters. This study trained and tested the model on five different publicly available datasets and evaluated it using metrics including precision, recall, and F-measure.

However, traditional clustering methods only provide a set of results without any explanations. While numerous methods in the literature attempt to explain clustering results, the explanation rules provided by these models are fixed and sacrificing clustering quality for the sake of making the rules easier to understand. To address this, this paper proposes a feature selection model to balance the interpretability and clustering quality. The model consists of two stages. In the first stage, the concept of explanatory radius is defined, and the explanatory radius of each cluster in the initial clustering results is calculated. In the second stage, a feature subspace is selected, and the dataset is re-clustered in this subspace using a proposed formula to obtain a new clustering result. Three objective functions are designed to evaluate the performance of the new clustering results in terms of cluster quality and interpretability. Subsequently, the model utilizes a multi-objective optimization framework to optimize the three objective functions in the solution space formed by different feature subspaces, resulting in a set of Pareto solutions. Each solution in the Pareto set represents a trade-off between clustering quality and interpretability. Finally, the contribution of features during the generation process of each cluster is used to represent the interpretability of each cluster’s result. The proposed method is validated on both artificial datasets and real-world datasets, and comparative analyses are conducted with the latest explainable clustering algorithms in the literature. The analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","Feature selection; interpretability; K-means clustering","Adversarial machine learning; Feature Selection; K-means clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Unsupervised learning; Clustering quality; Clustering results; Clusterings; Feature subspace; Features selection; Interpretability; K-means; K-means++ clustering; Objective functions; Optimization framework; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003652756"

IIoT networks, while enhancing service quality, are particularly susceptible to security risks because of their intrinsic interconnectedness and the use of low-power devices. The data produced by millions of sensors in the IIoT is highly dynamic, diverse, and of massive magnitude. The risk of dangers to IoT gadgets in a nuclear plant or a petroleum refinery is significantly greater when compared to that of home appliances. Often connected to the internet, IIoT devices and systems lack robust security measures, rendering them susceptible to cyberattacks. A breach in IIoT security could result in data theft, equipment damage, or even physical harm. To mitigate these risks, IIoT systems require secure authentication and encryption protocols, regular software updates, and proactive monitoring and response capabilities. These methods' primary disadvantages are their difficulty in implementation and inability to ensure effective security. Hence, a second line of protection, such as intrusion threat detection in IIoT, is required. In this research, we propose a new threat intrusion detection model in the IIoT through a genetic algorithm with attention mechanism and modified Adam optimized LSTM (GA-mADAM-IIoT). The GA-mADAM-IIoT consists of six modules: the activity receiver, communication module (CM), attention module (AM), intrusion detection module, mitigation module, and alert module. The GA was designed for feature dimensionality and selection trained on network flow data via a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was modified in order to optimize the LSTM (mADAM-LSTM) networks. To enhance the performance of our model, the categorical cross-entropy (CCE) cost function was used to calculate the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Additionally, the CCE cost function optimized the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values in terms of probability distributions. The Modified Adam (mADAM) optimization algorithm updates the weights and biases of the LSTM to minimize the cost function. Due to the limited availability of real-world datasets containing accurately labelled anomalies, particularly for industrial facilities and manufacturing facilities, we have utilized two sensor datasets derived from physical test-bed systems for water treatment: Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and Water Distribution (WADI). In these datasets, operators have simulated attack scenarios that occur in real-world water treatment plants and have recorded these instances as the ground truth anomalies. A regularization parameter was added to the cost function to prevent LSTM from overfitting. In order to improve the model's performance, the AM integrates a succinct yet effective attention mechanism that enhances significant information in the output of the CM. This reduces the burden on GA-mADAM-IIoT to detect threat patterns at the IDS module. The experimental findings showed that the threat detection GA-mADAM-IIoT via GA feature dimensionality and modified Adam LSTM outperforms the ablation studies. Furthermore, we improve the suggested transparency of threat detection by integrating the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) technique from Explainable AI. This enhances the trustworthiness and comprehensibility of the threat detection process. The proposed model was also compared with the state-of-the-art models, and our results showed outstanding accuracy of 99.98 %, AUC of 100 %, recall of 99.98 %, precision of 99.98 %, F1 of 99.98 %, and MCC of 99.66 % on SWaT data. On the WADI, we obtained an accuracy of 99.87 %, AUC of 100 %, recall of 99.87 %, precision of 99.87 %, F1-score of 99.87 %, and MCC of 98.20 %. The proposed GA-mADAM-IIoT is a generalized model that can be integrated with other IIoT security solutions, such as firewalls and access controls, to provide comprehensive security coverage in real time. © 2024 The Authors","Adam optimizer; Attention mechanism; Cyber threat; Cyber-physical systems; Explainable AI; Genetic algorithm; Industrial internet of things; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP)","Authentication; Compact disks; Computer viruses; Cyber attacks; Depreciation; Direction of arrival; Emergency services; Foundry practice; Gas oils; Gasoline; Intrusion detection; Liquefied petroleum gas; Medium access control; Mineral oils; Network intrusion; Network security; Nuclear power plants; Pareto principle; Petroleum refining; Petroleum tar; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Virtual storage; Adaptive moment estimation optimizer; Attention mechanisms; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber threats; Cyber-physical systems; Explainable AI; Industrial internet of thing; Moment estimation; Optimizers; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Short term memory; Cost functions","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","26663511","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203151356"

In order to effectively predict warpage, traditional methods use a large amount of data to perform statistical analysis. However, in the actual field, obtaining detailed parameter data for each process requires a lot of time and manpower, which makes statistical method impractical. In other words, achieving accurate warpage prediction with limited data is crucial. Therefore, this research proposes an artificial neural network model with genetic algorithms to enhance warpage prediction. The proposed algorithm uses genetic algorithms to achieve optimize the hyperparameter of artificial neural network (ANN), which is called Genetic Algorithm Optimized Artificial Neural Network (GA-NN), the algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed and performance of the ANN. The data set was generated by the finite element method from the semiconductor packaging product feature data. Compared with other algorithms, the product data simulated by the proposed method can maintain numerical stability and achieve rapid convergence. In the proposed ANN, an interpretable AI algorithm - SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is also used to further analyze various input parameters and quantify the operation results of the machine learning model. The empirical result shows that the prediction has an error of only 3 % on Molding Functional Chip Ball Grid Array (MFCBGA) package products. Compared with traditional algorithms and other machine learning methods, the proposed algorithm performs faster and with higher prediction accuracy, while providing product feature influence and visualizes the direct relationship between product specifications and warpage. To sum up, this research achieves effective package warpage prediction, while further explains the relationship between warpage generation in the AI model, input data and prediction targets to customers. Finally, the product design cycle can be reduced and the product quality can be improved simultaneously. © 2025 IEEE.","Explainable; FEM simulation; machine learning; MFCBGA; SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)","Additives; Chip scale packages; Finite element method; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Integrated circuits; Intelligent control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Packaging; Product design; Specifications; Statistical methods; Timing circuits; Ball-grid arrays; Explainable; FEM simulations; Functionals; Machine-learning; Molding functional chip ball grid array; Neural-networks; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Warpages; Learning systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Electronics Packaging Society (EPS)","75th IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference, ECTC 2025","27 May 2025 through 30 May 2025","Dallas","210005","05695503","979-833153932-0","PECCA","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010604052"

Although, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is utilized as a standard measurement to assess psoriasis severity in clinical trials, it has many draw-backs such as (1) patient burden for in-person clinic visits for assessment of psoriasis, (2) time required for investigator scoring and (3) variability of inter-and intra-rater scoring. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel and inter-pretable deep learning architecture called PSO-Net, which maps digital images from different anatomical regions to derive attention-based scores. Regional scores are further combined to estimate an absolute PASI score. Moreover, we devise a novel regression activation map for interpretability through ranking attention scores. Using this approach, we achieved inter-class correlation scores of 82.2% [95% CI: 77- 87%] and 87.8% [95% CI: 84-91%] with two different clinician raters, respectively. © 2025 IEEE.","Attention; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; PASI; Psoriasis","Area index; Assessment system; Attention; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Neural-networks; Psoriasi; Psoriasi area and severity index; Severity index; Skin conditions; Convolutional neural networks","IEEE Computer Society","et al.; Houston Methodist; IEEE Signal Processing Society; United Imaging; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Verasonics","22nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, ISBI 2025","14 April 2025 through 17 April 2025","Houston","208856","19457928","979-833152052-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005824989"

We focus on two topics—basic first aid and production scheduling in companies—for which we created two datasets of parallel course texts in Spanish and Basque. The manual evaluation reveals that both the open-source Llama3 instructed models (8B and 70B) and the proprietary GPT-4o can generate MCQs of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting for Spanish. No significant differences were observed in performance based on model size or licensing type, with performance rates of 91%, 84%, and 80% for GPT-4o, Llama3-70B, and Llama3-8B, respectively. However, the results for Basque show a marked decline, with performance dropping to 70% for GPT-4o and 59% for Llama3-70B, and a notably low 27% for Llama3-8B.

However, traditional predictive maintenance methods often face challenges in adapting to diverse industrial environments and ensuring the transparency and fairness of their predictions. This paper presents a novel predictive maintenance framework that integrates deep learning and optimization techniques while addressing key ethical considerations, such as transparency, fairness, and explainability, in artificial intelligence driven decision-making. The framework employs an Autoencoder for feature reduction, a Convolutional Neural Network for pattern recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory network for temporal analysis. To enhance transparency, the decision-making process of the framework is made interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand and trust the model’s predictions. Additionally, Particle Swarm Optimization is used to refine hyperparameters for optimal performance and mitigate potential biases in the model. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets from different industrial scenarios, with performance validated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time metrics. The results demonstrate an impressive accuracy of up to 99.92% and 99.45% across different datasets, highlighting the framework’s effectiveness in enhancing predictive maintenance strategies. Furthermore, the model’s explainability ensures that the decisions can be audited for fairness and accountability, aligning with ethical standards for critical systems. By addressing transparency and reducing potential biases, this framework contributes to the responsible and trustworthy deployment of artificial intelligence in industrial environments, particularly in safety-critical applications. The results underscore its potential for wide application across various industrial contexts, enhancing both performance and ethical decision-making.

Recently, large language models have been suggested as potential tools for various applications in health care. OBJECTIVE: Assess suggested management recommendations provided by a generative artificial intelligence chatbot with those of a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team to evaluate applicability in clinical settings. DESIGN: Comparative pilot study where management recommendations from a generative artificial intelligence chatbot for patients with anal or colorectal cancers were compared against historical consensus decisions from multidisciplinary team meetings. SETTING: Single referral tertiary center. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients (mean age of 66.5 years; 53.5% woman) were included; 80% were primarily diagnosed with rectal cancer, predominantly stage II and III disease (46.6%). The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 4 cm. INTERVENTIONS: From a generative artificial intelligence chatbot, we generated management recommendations for each patient, which were subsequently compared to historical decisions from a multidisciplinary team to gauge concordance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included a degree of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the multidisciplinary team decisions, assessed on a scale from 1 (complete disagreement) to 5 (complete agreement), and justification was evaluated by 3 experienced colorectal surgeons. RESULTS: A generative artificial intelligence chatbot achieved a high concordance rate with multidisciplinary team decisions, with an average concordance rating of 4.08. Multidisciplinary team treatment strategies included neoadjuvant therapy for 33.3% of patients, upfront surgery for 26.6%, and further diagnostic assessment for 20%. Interrater agreement on concordance was found to be moderate (κ coefficient range, 0.333-0.577), whereas agreement on decision justification was slight (κ coefficient range, 0.047-0.094). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study with small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a high level of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the decisions from a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team, suggesting the potential of large language models to support clinical decision-making in the management of anal and colorectal cancers.  © The ASCRS 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Colorectal cancer; Large language models; Multidisciplinary team discussions","Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Care Team; Pilot Projects; adult; aged; anus cancer; Article; cancer staging; ChatGPT; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; female; generative artificial intelligence; health care; human; interrater reliability; large language model; male; managed care; multidisciplinary team; neoadjuvant therapy; outcome assessment; patient referral; pilot study; rectum cancer; retrospective study; very elderly; artificial intelligence; colorectal tumor; diagnosis; middle aged; organization and management; patient care team; therapy","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","","","","","","00123706","","DICRA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206805288"

SoP is a crucial metric defining lithium-ion batteries’ power efficiency. Contrary to the State of Charge (SoC), the SoP assessment suggests the battery is being utilized under demanding conditions. This research introduces a new hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLstm) architectures. The predictive performance of the hybrid method is improved even further by utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter adjustment. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, are utilized to understand model predictions and determine the crucial factors influencing SoP. The predictive models underwent training and evaluation using a dataset from NASA, focusing on lithium-ion batteries. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model, incorporating PSO optimization, achieves exceptional accuracy. It yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.09, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.03, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.17, and an R2 value of 98%. Comparing these measures to individual models without PSO, there has been a noticeable improvement. The model's transparency and dependability are increased by using SHAP values, which provide a deep knowledge of the importance of features like battery voltage and current.

Herein, a hybrid intelligent framework for process parameter optimization of LPBF-ed Ti with improved ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) was proposed. It combines the data augmentation method (AVG ± EC × SD), the multi-model fusion stacking ensemble learning model (GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost), the interpretable machine learning method and the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ). The GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost outperforms single models in predicting UTS and EL across the accuracy, generalization ability and stability. The SHAP analysis reveals that laser power (P) is the most important feature affecting both UTS and EL, and it has a positive impact on them when P < 220 W. The UTS and EL of samples fabricated by the optimal process parameters were 718 ± 5 MPa and 27.9 % ± 0.1 %, respectively. The outstanding strength-ductility balance is attributable to the forward stresses in hard α’-martensite and back stresses in soft αm’-martensite induced by the strain gradients of hetero-microstructure. The back stresses strengthen the soft αm’-martensite, improving the overall UTS. The forward stresses stimulate the activation of dislocations in hard α’-martensite and the generation of 〈c + a〉 dislocations, allowing the plastic strain to occur in hard regions and enhancing the overall ductility. This work provides a feasible strategy for multi-objective optimization and valuable insights into tailoring the microstructure for improving mechanical properties. © 2025","Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; SHAP analysis; Titanium","Dislocations (crystals); Hydroelasticity; Layered manufacturing; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Titanium powder metallurgy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Powder bed; Property; SHAP analyze; Tensile elongation; Titania; Ultimate tensile strength; Tensile strength","Chinese Society of Metals","","","","","","10050302","","JSCTE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218415692"

This article introduces a novel LLM evolutionary algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates, and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel closed box metaheuristic optimization algorithms for box-constrained, continuous optimization problems automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and differential evolution) on the 5-D closed box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-D instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Automated code generation; evolutionary computation (EC); large language models (LLMs); metaheuristics; optimization","Automatic test pattern generation; Computational linguistics; Heuristic algorithms; Algorithm framework; Automated code generation; Automated generation; Complex codes; Language model; Large language model; Metaheuristic; Natural languages; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Constrained optimization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003241288"

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary computation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based Evolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained great performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the properties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic search spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity measurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches, including FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal that while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its objective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo’s reflection mechanism yields good objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this finding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that maintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search algorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity indices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective. These results underscore the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation and understanding heuristic search spaces in designing frameworks in LLM-EPS.

We find that, although ChatGPT did not generate false or misleading responses, ChatGPT responses were typically less than optimal in terms of their similarity to guidances from the federal government. While delivered in an authoritative tone, these responses at times omitted important information and contained points of emphasis that were substantially different than those from Ready.gov.

Among them, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is a powerful approach to generate molecules with desired physiochemical and pharmacological properties. However, the CVAE’s latent space is still a black-box, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the latent space and molecular properties. To address this issue, we propose the Interpretable Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE), which introduces a modified loss function that correlates the latent value with molecular properties. ICVAE established a linear mapping between latent variables and molecular properties. This linearity is not only crucial for improving interpretability, by assigning clear semantic meaning to latent dimensions, but also provides a practical advantage. It enables direct manipulation of molecular attributes through simple coordinate shifts in latent space, rather than relying on opaque, black-box optimization algorithms. Our experimental results show that the ICVAE can linearly relate one or multiple molecular properties with the latent value and generate molecules with precise properties by controlling the latent values. The ICVAE’s interpretability allows us to gain insight into the molecular generation process, making it a promising approach in drug discovery and material design. © 2025 by the authors.","drug discovery; molecular generation; variational autoencoder","Algorithms; Autoencoder; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Machine Learning; algorithm; article; autoencoder; drug development; generative model; human; machine learning; autoencoder; drug design; machine learning; procedures","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","16616596","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004891763"

These models have exhibited remarkable abilities in achieving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but the performance depends highly on the quality of prompting. Prompt engineering methods have been promoted for further extending the models' abilities to perform different applications. However, prompt engineering involves crafting input prompts for better accuracy and efficiency, demanding substantial expertise with trial-and-error effort. Automating the prompting process is important and can largely reduce human efforts in building suitable prompts. In this work, we develop a new metaheuristic algorithm to couple the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique and LLMs for prompt optimization. Our approach has some unique features: it can converge within only a small number of iterations (i.e., typically 10–20 iterations) to vastly reduce the expensive LLM usage cost; it can easily be applied to conduct many kinds of tasks owing to its simplicity and efficiency; and most importantly, it does not need to depend so much on the quality of initial prompts, because it can improve the prompts through learning more effectively based on enormous existing data. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments with several types of NLP datasets and compared them to others. The results highlight the importance of coupling metaheuristic search algorithms and LLMs for prompt optimization, proving that the presented approach can be adopted to enhance the performance of LLMs. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ChatGPT; large language model; machine learning; particle swarm optimization; prompt optimization","ChatGPT; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Prompt optimization; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","02664720","","EXSYE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004212189"

Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs.

Machine learning can significantly accelerate the discovery and design process of new materials. However, as the number of elements in the alloy and target performance metrics increase, alloy optimization becomes more challenging. To address this, this paper proposes a machine learning–based multi-objective optimization method for magnesium alloy fracturing balls. The machine learning model trained on the magnesium alloy corrosion and ultimate compressive strength database achieves an accuracy of 0.98 on the training set and 0.93 on the test set. By using a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the element ratios of the magnesium alloy, Mg-6.4Al-3.4Zn-4.6Cu was obtained, with a corrosion rate of 538 mm/year and an ultimate compressive strength of 369 MPa.

It also explored how proficiency level of learners mediated the successful use of the target form. Sixty Turkish EFL learners were employed and distributed into three groups: reformulations (n = 20), elicitations (n = 20), and control (n = 20). During the online delivery of courses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the learners met their instructors synchronously outside class times over a period of five weeks for the administration of the treatment and data collection. To prompt the use of the target linguistic structure, the researcher developed an oral production task. The immediate learner uptake measures and pretest-posttest results were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of both feedback strategies. The analysis comparing the measure of learner uptake indicated a greater number of successful corrections for reformulations. The data from the pretest-posttest measures also suggested that the reformulations group outperformed the elicitations and control group. It was also revealed that the proficiency level of learners had a mediating role only for reformulations.

Objectives: To evaluate patisiran efficacy and safety in post hoc analysis of the Brazilian subpopulation of APOLLO-B. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) in functional capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included CFB to Month 12 in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. Exploratory endpoints included CFB in cardiac biomarkers and Perugini grade of cardiac uptake during technetium-99m scintigraphy. Results: Forty-two patients enrolled in Brazil (patisiran, n=20; placebo, n=22). Patisiran showed benefit in 6MWT and KCCQ-OS scores vs. placebo; CFB (95% confidence interval [CI]) in 6MWT (median) and KCCQ-OS scores (least squares mean) was –2.0 m (–58.5, 42.9) and 9.37 (1.93, 16.81) points with patisiran vs. –30.1 m (–72.2, 3.5) and 2.62 (–4.68, 9.92) points for placebo. For cardiac biomarkers, the mean fold-change from baseline (95% CI) for N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I was 1.31 (1.06, 1.61) and 1.12 (0.94, 1.34) for patisiran, and 1.71 (1.39, 2.10) and 1.28 (1.08, 1.53) for placebo, respectively. Perugini grade improved in 11/18 (61.1%) and 0/10 evaluable patients with patisiran and placebo, respectively. There were no deaths in the patisiran group vs. 3 in the placebo group. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of patisiran in Brazilian patients with ATTR-CM in APOLLO-B were consistent with those in the global study population.

They serve to examine a system’s structure (e.g., what concepts are critical to spreading an intervention’s effects?) and long-term behavior (e.g., if we increase fruit availability, how will its consumption change?). When modelers build FCMs by leveraging participants’ knowledge, the resulting participant-built FCMs can be analyzed and interpreted since participants report perceived causality. However, engaging enough knowledgeable participants to construct an FCM can be challenging. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms derive FCMs from data by selecting relationships to maximize a metric such as accuracy, which can produce overly dense FCMs where relationships may not represent valid causal mechanisms—this hinders the critically important interpretability of FCMs. In this paper, we address the need for expert knowledge and the validity of causal mechanisms in FCMs. Specifically, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide algorithms in building FCMs where valid pairs of concepts are connected in the right causal direction and with the correct causal type (increase/decrease). Our approach combines LLMs with CMA-ES, a ubiquitous, state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm. Using three real-world case studies and several LLMs, we show our method successfully (i) learns sparse FCMs that fit the data well and (ii) represents valid causal relationships. Moreover, the learned FCMs are sparser than the corresponding participant-built ones, demonstrating our method may help simplify existing FCMs and selectively includes causal relationships, which is essential to build trustworthy and interpretable FCMs. © The Author(s) 2025.","CMA-ES; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Large language models","Adversarial machine learning; Digital elevation model; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Causal relationships; CMA-ES; Cognitive maps; Language model; Large language model; Learn+; Relationship between concepts; S effect; Simulation model; Weighted digraph; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09410643","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000464383"

Traditional in vivo methods for determining OP toxicity are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we developed a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict acute rat toxicity of OPs using two-dimensional molecular and quantum chemical descriptors, optimized through genetic algorithm-based multiple linear regression (GA-MLR). The optimal model demonstrated robust performance with the following statistical parameters: coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7451, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) coefficient (Q2Loo) of 0.6208, external test set coefficient of determination (R2ext) of 0.7360. These metrics indicate excellent generalization and predictive capabilities of the model. Interpretative analysis of the model revealed that NumHDonors and PEOE_VSA were the most significant descriptors influencing OP toxicity. An increase in hydrogen bond donors within OP molecules reduces toxicity, as these donors enhance hydrophilicity, diminishing membrane permeability. Moreover, the PEOE_VSA descriptor characterizes the partial charge properties of OP molecules, reflecting their electrostatic interactions with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) during binding, which influences toxicity. This study presents an optimized modeling strategy designed for small datasets, enabling stable feature selection and accurate assessment of their contributions to toxicity prediction. This research provides a reliable QSAR approach for OP toxicity prediction while offering new insights into toxicity mechanisms. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","acute toxicity; machine learning; molecular descriptors; multiple linear regression; Organophosphates; QSAR","Administration, Oral; Algorithms; Animals; Linear Models; Male; Organophosphates; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Multiple linear regression; Prediction models; Toxicity; organophosphate; Acute toxicity; Coefficient of determination; Descriptors; Machine-learning; Molecular descriptors; Multiple linear regressions; Organophosphate; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling; Toxicity predictions; detection method; hydrogen; multiple regression; organophosphate; toxicity; algorithm; animal; chemistry; male; oral drug administration; procedures; quantitative structure activity relation; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; statistical model; toxicity testing; Hydrogen bonds","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","03601234","","JPFCD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004067409"

This study aims to optimize the energy efficiency, specifically the Coefficient of Performance (COP), of solar-powered absorption cooling systems using advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. For this purpose, predictive models employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were developed. Subsequently, nature-inspired optimization techniques, including Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were explored to improve the prediction skills. The study utilized three distinct feature combinations to capture various operational and environmental parameters, and the models were evaluated using several statistical metrics. The results demonstrated significant improvements in predictive accuracy with the optimized models. Combination 1 (C1) achieved near-perfect goodness-of-fit values with marginal gains from optimization, while Combination 2 (C2) also showed high values with slight reductions in the optimized models. Similarly, Combination 3 (C3) initially had lower performance. Still, optimization techniques notably improved the goodness-of-fit values, with ANN-CSO showing an 11.46 % increase, ANN-MFOA a 10.36 % increase, and ANN-WOA a 10.54 % increase. Further feature importance using SHAP analysis indicated that the most influential parameters were heat absorption (Qa), heat exchange rate (Qe), cooling capacity (Qc), and heat dissipation (Qd), with solar irradiance (Ir) having a minor impact. These findings indicate that the optimization techniques are particularly effective for feature sets that initially underperform. The study recommends integrating these advanced optimization methods into the design and operation of solar-powered absorption cooling systems to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Future research should explore the scalability and adaptability of these optimized models across different climatic regions, incorporate real-time data, and investigate the economic and long-term stability aspects under various operational scenarios to ensure comprehensive practical implementation and sustainability benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for efficient and accurate CKD detection is vital to enhancing diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to develop an interpretable CAD system that not only achieves high prediction accuracy but also provides insights into the factors influencing these predictions, aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making. We applied random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and XGBoost (XGB) classifiers to a UCI CKD dataset containing 400 samples and 24 attributes, addressing missing values with K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation. To enhance model performance, we employed a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection and utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpretability. The classifiers achieved accuracies of 98.33%, 95.83%, 98.33%, and 99.17% for RF, DT, LR, and XGB, respectively, using all features. Feature selection with the Genetic Algorithm improved accuracy to 99.17% for both RF and LR, while DT accuracy increased to 97.50%, and XGBoost’s accuracy remained at 99.17%. SHAP analysis identified serum creatinine, hemoglobin, specific gravity, and albumin as the most influential features in CKD prediction. These findings demonstrate that the developed CAD system meets the study’s aims by offering high predictive accuracy alongside critical interpretability, enabling informed clinical decisions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Chronic kidney disease; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning; SHAP","","Springer Nature","","","","","","27314812","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212129949"

Accurately estimating porosity is crucial for reservoir characterization, well planning, and production optimization in the oil and gas industry. Traditional porosity determination methods, such as porosimetry, geostatistical, and core analysis, often involve complex geological and geophysical models, which are expensive and time-consuming. This study used the integrated machine learning and optimization model of differential evolution (DE) with group method of data handling (GMDH-DE) to estimate the porosity using integrated well log and core data from the Mpyo oil field, Uganda. The GMDH-DE demonstrates superior performance compared with conventional GMDH, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9925 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0017 during training, an R2 of 0.9845 with an RMSE of 0.0121 during testing, and when validated the R2 was 0.9825 with RMSE of 0.00018. A key novelty of this work is the integration of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which provides an interpretable analysis of the model’s input features. SHAP reveals that bulk density (RHOB) and neutron porosity (NPHI) are the most critical parameters for porosity estimation, offering valuable insight into features importance. The proposed GMDH-DE model and SHAP analysis represent a novel and independent approach for accurate porosity estimation and interpretability, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of hydrocarbon exploration and development.

Existing research usually used predefined models to explain the relationship between the weight and the length of crabs. In this paper, we propose an effective regression method using genetic programming (GP) to build explainable models, which include more features to explore potential relationships between the weight and the physical features of crabs. The GP-based method has been evaluated on a publicly available dataset of crabs. The experimental results were compared with several baseline methods for predicting two kinds of crab weights. GP shows the best performance among all the baseline methods on the test set, i.e., 90.8% for predicting the weight of crabs and 81.3% for predicting the shucked weight of crabs in terms of coefficient of determination. Thanks to the explicit ability of feature selection, GP can select more important features to improve the prediction performance. More importantly, the generated models can provide potential interpretability, which is particularly valuable for domain experts in fisheries management and ecological research. © 2025 The Authors","Crab; Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic programming; Symbolic regression; Weight prediction","artificial intelligence; crab; data set; genetic analysis; numerical model; regression analysis; weight","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15749541","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002859386"

The RC denotes a failure to infer bidirectional relationships that undermines logical reasoning capabilities. Under the RC, LLMs are unable to infer bidirectional relationships effectively leading to logical errors in deductive reasoning. If a model is trained on a sentence of the form “A relates to B”, it does not automatically generalize to the reverse form, “B relates to A”. Through a systematic literature review and experimental analysis, we highlight the difficulties in maintaining causal coherence in state-of-the-art LLMs. Recognizing the RC as a persistent problem across architectures, we review mitigation strategies including data augmentation and innovative training objectives to offer valuable insights into the root causes and discuss their limitations.

By integrating a lightweight LSTM-attention neural network as the denoiser within a diffusion framework, PPD offers an innovative and efficient approach to polypeptide generation. Evaluations demonstrate that the PPD model can generate diverse and novel polypeptide sequences across various testing conditions, achieving high pLDDT scores when folded by ESMFold. In comparison to the ProteinDiffusionGenerator B (PDG-B) model, a relevant benchmark in the field, PPD exhibits the ability to produce longer and more diverse polypeptide sequences. This improvement is attributed to PPD’s optimized architecture and expanded training dataset, which enhance its understanding of protein structural pattern.

Large language models may serve as an accessible method to improve patient educational material. The aim of this study was to compare readability between existing educational materials and those generated by large language models. Methods: Baseline colorectal surgery educational materials were gathered from a large academic institution (n = 52). Three prompts were entered into Perplexity and ChatGPT 3.5 for each topic: a Basic prompt that simply requested patient educational information the topic, an Iterative prompt that repeated instruction asking for the information to be more health literate, and a Metric-based prompt that requested a sixth-grade reading level, short sentences, and short words. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level or Grade Level, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease or Ease, and Modified Grade Level scores were calculated for all materials, and unpaired t tests were used to compare mean scores between baseline and documents generated by artificial intelligence platforms. Results: Overall existing materials were longer than materials generated by the large language models across categories and prompts: 863–956 words vs 170–265 (ChatGPT) and 220–313 (Perplexity), all P < .01. Baseline materials did not meet sixth-grade readability guidelines based on grade level (Grade Level 7.0–9.8 and Modified Grade Level 9.6–11.5) or ease of readability (Ease 53.1–65.0). Readability of materials generated by a large language model varied by prompt and platform. Overall, ChatGPT materials were more readable than baseline materials with the Metric-based prompt: Grade Level 5.2 vs 8.1, Modified Grade Level 7.3 vs 10.3, and Ease 70.5 vs 60.4, all P < .01. In contrast, Perplexity-generated materials were significantly less readable except for those generated with the Metric-based prompt, which did not statistically differ. Conclusion: Both existing materials and the majority of educational materials created by large language models did not meet readability recommendations. The exception to this was with ChatGPT materials generated with a Metric-based prompt that consistently improved readability scores from baseline and met recommendations in terms of the average Grade Level score. The variability in performance highlights the importance of the prompt used with large language models. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","","Colorectal Surgery; Comprehension; Health Literacy; Humans; Language; Patient Education as Topic; Reading; Teaching Materials; Article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; colon biopsy; colorectal patient; colorectal surgery; electronic medical record; engineering; human; large language model; ostomy; patient; patient education; prompt engineering; reading; sigmoidoscopy; comparative study; comprehension; education; educational material; health literacy; language; procedures","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00396060","","SURGA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214096430"

In this paper, an advanced deep learning model integrating Explainable Vision Transformer (EViT) architecture with Selective Kernel Learning (SKL) and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) method has been proposed. The EViT model utilizes the capability of vision transformer by incorporating SKL method for dynamic selection of optimal kernels to enhance the feature extraction. This process also improves the identification of relevant patterns and structures in the tissue samples. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using MODE algorithm to improve the model's efficiency and interpretability. For preprocessing the input histopathological images of colon cancer non-local mean filtering method is used enabling precise path extraction and feature embeddings. By incorporating MODE algorithm for hyperparameter optimization balancing accuracy and reliability ensuring better efficiency of the model. The explainability of the model is facilitated by using Gradient Weighted Class Average Mapping (GRAD-CAM) and attention maps to improve decision making process. Experimentation has been carried out on histopathological images of colon cancer. EViT model performs better with an accuracy of 93.2%.

However, recent research has explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising alternative. This paper introduces TreeC, a machine learning method that utilises the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy metaheuristic algorithm to generate an interpretable EMS modelled as a decision tree. Unlike RBC and MPC approaches, TreeC learns the decision strategy of the EMS based on historical data, adapting the control model to the controlled energy grid. The decision strategy is represented as a decision tree, providing interpretability compared to RL methods that often rely on black-box models like neural networks. TreeC is evaluated against MPC with perfect forecast and RL EMSs in two case studies taken from literature: an electric grid case and a household heating case. In the electric grid case, TreeC achieves an average energy loss and constraint violation score of 19.2, which is close to MPC and RL EMSs that achieve scores of 14.4 and 16.2 respectively. All three methods control the electric grid well especially when compared to the random EMS, which obtains an average score of 12 875.

Although Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristics (GPHH) have demonstrated strong adaptability to such uncertainties by evolving dynamic routing policies, their complex decision-making processes hinder interpretability. To address this, a novel framework called Differential Evolution with Random Ablation (DERA) is introduced to generate diverse and feasible counterfactual explanations. Unlike traditional methods, DERA systematically explores multiple counterfactual scenarios by integrating random ablation into the optimisation process, thereby uncovering a broader range of plausible alternatives. Experimental results across various UCARP instances show that DERA consistently achieves high feasibility, minimal feature changes, and greater diversity in counterfactual explanations compared to baseline methods. This diversity enables a more comprehensive understanding of GPHH-evolved policies, providing actionable insights to improve decision-making transparency and robustness in dynamic environments.  © 2025 IEEE.","","Decision making; Dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Capacitated arc routing problem; Counterfactuals; Differential Evolution; Hyper-heuristics; Real-world; Service costs; Stochastics; Task demand; Uncertainty; Waste collection; Ablation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","","979-833153431-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010426787"

In this study, a random forest (RF) model is employed as a baseline predictive tool for estimating peak outflow. To enhance its predictive performance, Squirrel search algorithm (SSA), Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), and Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) are integrated to optimize the model hyperparameters. A dataset comprising 128 documented dam failure cases is augmented to train and test prediction models. The results demonstrate that the SSA-RF model trained on the augmented dataset achieve outstanding predictive accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9999, root mean square error (RMSE) of 56.693, mean absolute error (MAE) of 23.935, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.105, variance accounted for (VAF) of 99.986 %, and A-20 index of 0.924 on the test set. Furthermore, several model interpretability techniques are employed to evaluate the influence of input variables on the predictions. The results indicate that the height of water above the breach (Hw) and the reservoir storage volume above the breach (Vw) are the most critical factors influencing peak outflow predictions. This study provides a novel perspective based on artificial intelligence for peak outflow's prediction and assessment of dam failure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Dam failure; Metaheuristic algorithm; Model interpretability; Peak outflow; Random Forest","Artificial intelligence; Dams; Errors; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Outages; Prediction models; Random forests; Reservoirs (water); Statistical tests; Accurate prediction; Dam failure; Emergency response planning; Interpretability; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Model interpretability; Peak outflow; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Search Algorithms; artificial intelligence; dam failure; flood; optimization; outflow; reservoir; Mean square error","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00221694","","JHYDA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010521519"

For example, classifiers that do not perform data transformations (e.g., cluster-based) perform better when the different classes are separated, typically requiring preprocessed data. Other models (e.g., decision trees) can perform several splits in the feature space, easily obtaining perfect results in training data, but have a higher risk of overfitting with unprocessed data. We use the rbd-GP and M3GP genetic programming algorithms to induce new features based on the original features, to be used by shallow and deep decision tree and random forest models. M3GP is wrapped around a learning algorithm, using its performance as fitness. This way, the induced features are adapted to the classifier, allowing us to compare the complexity of the features induced for the different classifiers. We measure the complexity of the induced features using several structural and functional complexity metrics found in the literature, also proposing a new metric that measures the separability of classes in the feature space. Like other authors, we use complexity as an interpretability metric, selecting three models to discuss and validate based on their performance and size. We apply these methods to remote sensing classification problems and solve two tasks that are hard due to the high similarity between the land cover classes: detecting cocoa agroforest and forecasting forest degradation up to one year in the future. © 2024","Classification; Feature construction; Forest degradation; Genetic programming; Model complexity; Model interpretability; Remote sensing; Time series","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Decision trees; Forest ecology; Random forests; Feature construction; Feature engineerings; Feature space; Forest degradation; Interpretability; Model interpretability; Modeling complexity; Performance; Remote-sensing; Times series; Genetic programming","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210540217"

Numerous methods have been investigated to deduce Boolean networks from observed temporal data. However, existing algorithms focus on improving accuracy while neglecting inference explainability. To offer inference explainability without sacrificing accuracy, this paper proposes an explainable multi-objective genetic programming approach to infer large-scale Boolean networks. Unlike existing single-objective algorithms, a new explainable optimization objective is introduced by calculating the average mutual information of the tree nodes. Subsequently, we develop a bio-inspired operation to fully utilize elite solutions and enhance the exploration capability. Additionally, a penalty term for syntax trees is introduced to mitigate overfitting and improve explainability by limiting the tree size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is interpretable and outperforms current leading algorithms in terms of accurately inferring large-scale Boolean networks. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Boolean network; Explainability; Genetic programming; Multi-objective optimization; Mutual information","Biomimetics; Boolean algebra; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Large scale systems; Multiobjective optimization; Trees (mathematics); Boolean Networks; Causal relationships; Discrete complexes; Explainability; Large-scales; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Mutual informations; State transitions; Temporal Data; Genetic programming","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010331205"

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a conceptual methodological approach that integrates a theoretical review to examine the factors influencing academic spin-offs’ decisions to cancel or reduce their presence in international markets, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, and at early or later stages of their internationalization process. Findings: The results suggest that academic spin-offs face more significant challenges in their internationalization process than other small- and medium-sized enterprises. Each of the factors analyzed can explain the type, extent and timing of de-internationalization, and their impact may vary according to the pattern of internationalization followed by these firms. Furthermore, this paper highlights that academic spin-offs de-internationalization processes are often influenced more by internal factors than by external ones. Equally, it is recognized that these factors do not act independently in de-internationalization but are interrelated and may be conditioned by each other. Originality/value: This study offers various perspectives by assessing the nonlinear internationalization patterns of academic spin-offs. Moreover, it contributes significantly to the literature on academic entrepreneurship and internationalization by integrating de-internationalization as an essential component of the international academic spin-off life cycle. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic entrepreneurship; Academic spin-off; Deinternationalization; Internationalization; Nonlinear internationalization","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","20596014","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003395834"

While CFT can be adaptive, it is also linked to psychological distress, including posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR). Objective: The present study aims to examine the relationship between the frequency and vividness of upward and downward counterfactual thoughts and PTSR, in the recent aftermath of sexual assault (SA). Method: The sample consisted of 327 women who had experienced SA within the last year. PTSR was measured using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), while CFT was assessed through self-reported frequency and vividness of upward (event could have been less severe or avoided) and downward (event could have been worse) counterfactual thoughts. Results: The results revealed a significant difference in the distribution of upward versus downward CFT. Specifically, more participants reported engaging in upward CFT ‘Very Often’ and ‘Often,’ while downward CFT was reported less frequently. Vividness was higher for downward CFT. Both frequency and vividness of upward and downward counterfactuals were significantly associated with higher levels of PTSR. Conclusion: The present findings highlight the role of counterfactual thinking in post-assault distress and emphasize the need for targeted interventions addressing CFT in the aftermath of trauma. © 2025 The Author(s).

The development of Explainable AI (XAI) methods has addressed this limitation by providing human-readable insights into these black-box models, which are widely used in image-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and localization. One popular and effective XAI technique is Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), which uses a large number of random masks to visualize model behavior. However, RISE’s requirement for numerous masks leads to high space complexity.

This study aims to enhance the original DRASTIC model by incorporating three methods to improve its accuracy and reliability in identifying vulnerable groundwater regions (to nitrate) in Zanjan aquifer, Iran. Owing to its remarkable ability, long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) algorithm was implemented to predict groundwater vulnerability based on nitrate contamination and DRASTIC framework. The LSTM model was optimized using the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and equilibrium optimizer (EO) metaheuristic algorithms. The results of the developed models (i.e. LSTM, LSTM-PSO, and LSTM-EO) were compared to those of the original DRASTIC model as a benchmark. Seven parameters of the DRASTIC framework, including depth to groundwater, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity, were used as inputs for the DL models, and the DRASTIC vulnerability index (DVI) derived from the original DRASTIC model, which was adjusted using nitrate samples, was considered as the output. Thereafter, the prioritization of DRASTIC parameters and their effectiveness were evaluated using the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) approach. Additionally, the models explainability was enhanced using the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach. Lastly, all the developed models were evaluated based on the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R²). The MDA results revealed that the soil media and the impact of the vadose zone parameters exerted the highest and lowest impact on the aquifer vulnerability in the study area, respectively, while the summary plot revealed that soil media exerted the highest impact. The vulnerability maps predicted by the DL model and its optimized versions indicated that the central parts of the aquifer exhibited the highest vulnerability, whereas nitrate concentration was low in the north, northwest, south, southeast, and southwest of the Zanjan aquifer. The correlation coefficient (r) between the nitrate concentrations and the LSTM-PSO, LSTM-EO, LSTM, and DRASTIC models was 0.81, 0.78, 0.76, and 0.35, respectively. This indicates the potential of the PSO and EO algorithms to significantly enhance the performance of the optimized LSTM models compared to the standalone LSTM model. Overall, the coupling of the DRASTIC and deep learning models can be a cost-effective tool in groundwater management. © 2025 The Author(s)","Aquifer vulnerability; DRASTIC; Equilibrium optimizer; LSTM; Nitrate; Zanjan aquifer","Associative storage; Benchmarking; Deep learning; Dynamic programming; Forward error correction; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Linear programming; Risk assessment; Time difference of arrival; Aquifer vulnerability; DRASTIC; DRASTIC model; Equilibrium optimizer; Memory modeling; Optimizers; Particle swarm optimizers; Short term memory; Soil medium; Zanjan aquifer; Mean square error","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25901230","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001228370"

The present study employed machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, enhanced by metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), to address the complexities of predicting shear strength. Comprehensive datasets (1334) incorporating key input parameters related to geometric, material, and mechanical properties were sourced from the literature. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to enhance the interpretability of the models by identifying the global and local importance of features. Moreover, five (5) evaluation matrices, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (RMSE). Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to check the model's performance. The results demonstrate that RF models consistently outperformed LSTM models in predictive accuracy and generalizability. Among the optimized models, RF-WOA-C1 achieved the best performance for Combination 1 (C1), RF-WOA-C2 excelled in Combination 2 (C2), and RF-MFOA-C3 was the top performer for Combination 3 (C3). For Combination 4 (C4), the standalone RF-C4 model delivered exceptional results without requiring additional optimization. SHAP analysis revealed that the projected weld collar (Aw) area, compressive strength of concrete (cm), and stud parameters were the most influential features in predicting shear strength. The research provides significant information regarding the applicability of ML techniques for predicting shear strength. The research can save time and avoid the need for expensive experimental testing. The outcomes enlighten future research and serve as a guide for engineering practice. The findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing RF-based approaches, optimizing critical parameters, and employing SHAP for transparency. © 2025 The Author(s)","Concrete; Machine learning; Prediction; SHAP; Shear strength; Stud connector","Compressive strength; Flame research; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Premixed flames; Random forests; Shear strength; Studs (structural members); Algorithm combinations; Headed stud; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Optimization algorithms; Random forests; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Shears strength; Stud connectors; Studs (fasteners)","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25901230","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218499522"

The success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in deep saline aquifers relies on accurately assessing CO2 solubility in brine under real operating conditions. Gaining detailed insight into CO2 behavior in subsurface environments is essential for effectively implementing this method. In this study, we have made substantial efforts to compile a comprehensive dataset on CO2 solubility in diverse aqueous electrolyte solutions of CaCl2, NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and KCl, encompassing a wide interval of operating conditions and widespread salt concentrations. To leverage this extensive dataset effectively, we applied a robust white-box machine learning technique, namely the multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) to establish user-friendly explicit correlations for accurately predicting CO2 solubility in numerous brines under subsurface conditions. Our evaluation revealed that the derived correlations provided significantly more precise predictions of CO2 solubility. In this context, the MGGP-based correlations demonstrated trustworthy accuracy with total root mean square error (RMSE) values of only 0.0235, 0.0304, 0.0196, 0.0289, and 0.0313 for CaCl2, NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and KCl solutions, respectively. Additionally, the trend analysis showed that the proposed correlations effectively captured the behavior of CO2 solubility across a wide range of operating pressures, temperatures, and solvent salinities, demonstrating their robustness and reliability. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provided useful insights into how different inputs contribute and interact, making the proposed correlations easier to understand and interpret. Lastly, the newly introduced MGGP-based correlations exhibit notable improvements in accuracy, user-friendliness, generalization, and explainability, ensuring superior performance across diverse subsurface conditions. These advancements mark a significant step forward in the cost-effective and precise estimation of CO2 solubility in various brines, making the proposed correlations highly valuable for applications in carbon capture and storage, environmental impact assessment, petroleum geology, reservoir engineering, and other CO2-related domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Brine; Carbon dioxide; Saline aquifers; Sequestration; Solubility","Carbon dioxides (CO); Deep saline aquifers; Effective approaches; Greenhouse gas emissions; Multi-gene genetic programming; Real operating conditions; Saline aquifers; Sequestration; Subsurface conditions; Subsurface environment; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; correlation; prediction; solubility; Genetic programming","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00119164","","DSLNA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002649390"

A stacking regression model combined with a Transformed Target Regressor (TTR) is proposed, utilizing three top-performing base models such as support vector regression (SVR), LightGBM (LGBM), and random forest (RF). The model incorporates 20 key thermodynamic, mismatch, and combination parameters (physical features) along with 18 different elements to enhance generalization and account for various input feature effects, specifically to predict the hardness of HEAs. Feature selection was done in two stages using the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pc) and conditional mutual information-based feature selection (CMIFS) methods. The impact of alloy composition and physical features on hardness was analyzed with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and partial dependence plots (PDPs), helping to better understand the model’s predictions. The stacked model outperformed the individual models, achieving an overall R2 score of 0.88 and 0.99 for composition and physical features-based data, respectively. Additionally, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the hardness of the HEAs, resulting in a more than 24% increase in hardness compared to the initial data. The optimized composition of Al17.24Fe24.79Cr1.95Mo6.84 Ti13.03 Nb7.89 Hf8.26 was identified as having the highest hardness.

While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their combined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains underexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to reduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning hyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the difficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster achievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration by substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions offered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios - (1) optimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for material classification - show that the method significantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs. Depending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60% compared to traditional PSO methods.

The interplay between LLMs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives and methodologies, share a common pursuit of applicability in complex problems. Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM’s further enhancement under closed box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches. Furthermore, the text processing and generative capabilities of LLMs would aid in deploying EAs across a wide range of tasks. Based on these complementary advantages, this article provides a thorough review and a forward-looking roadmap, categorizing the reciprocal inspiration into two main avenues: 1) LLM-enhanced EA and 2) EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the complementarity between LLMs and EAs in diverse scenarios, including code generation, software engineering, neural architecture search, and various generation tasks. As the first comprehensive review focused on the EA research in the era of LLMs, this article provides a foundational stepping stone for understanding the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. The identified challenges and future directions offer guidance for researchers and practitioners to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration in propelling advancements in optimization and artificial intelligence. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Algorithm generation; evolutionary algorithm (EA); large language model (LLM); neural architecture search (NAS); optimization problem; prompt engineering","Problem oriented languages; Algorithm generation; Evolutionary algorithm; Language model; Large language model; Natural languages; Neural architecture search; Neural architectures; Optimization problems; Prompt engineering; Roadmap; Software architecture","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003151410"

Conventional robot programming methods often fall short in achieving these complex behaviors. Behavior Trees (BTs) offer a promising alternative due to their modularity, scalability and reactivity. We propose utilizing general purpose, system-prompted Large Language Model (LLM) assistants to decompose task descriptions into executable BTs, which are subsequently refined using Genetic Programming (GP) and a state machine like low-resource BT execution simulator, where they will be tested for task completion. This approach eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby reducing computational costs and saving time and energy.

Histopathological examination of lymphoma tissue images is a diagnostic technique for detecting malignant lymphomas. Differentiating lymphoma subtypes manually is challenging due to their similar morphological features. This paper introduces a cutting-edge methodology for classifying malignant lymphoma using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. It integrates feature reduction using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and model optimization through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in conjunction with DenseNet121 architecture. The DenseNet121 model, which employs four distinct freezing strategies, extracts features from the images, generating an initial 4096 features per image. These features are subsequently reduced by more than 54.4% using PSO, thereby enhancing the computational efficiency without sacrificing classification accuracy. The trained GA Deep Neural Network (DNN) model achieved a significant score of 96.77% testing accuracy with high precision, recall and F1 scores as well. The results after comparison with other existing state-of-the-art models showed the usefulness of the proposed approach in terms of performance as well as the consumption of resources for medical imaging classification. It is recommended that the combined application of PSO for feature reduction and GA for model optimization can be successfully used for improving accuracy rate of such algorithms while reducing computation time. This technique is expected to be further developed and applied in different tasks of computer aided diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in particular the tasks with requirements for explainable artificial intelligence. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligent; deep learning; genetic algorithm; malignant lymphoma; optimized DenseNet121; particle swarm optimization","Deep neural networks; Diagnostic radiography; Artificial intelligent; Deep learning; Features reductions; Learning approach; Malignant lymphomas; Model optimization; Optimized densenet121; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007297582"

Gal. Milton Tavares de Souza, Rio de Janeiro, Niterói, 24210-310, Brazil","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective public health interventions during infectious disease outbreaks. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban human behaviour is essential for such responses. Crowd-sourced geo-data can be a valuable data source for this understanding. However, previous research often struggles with the complexity and heterogeneity of such data, facing challenges in the utilisation of multiple modalities and explainability. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to identify and rank multimodal time series features derived from mobile phone and geo-social media data based on their association with COVID-19 infection rates in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Our analysis spans from April 6, 2020, to August 31, 2021, and integrates 59 time series features. We introduce a feature selection algorithm based on Chatterjee’s Xi measure of dependence to identify relevant features on an Área Programática da Saúde (health area) and city-wide level. We then compare the predictive power of the selected features against those identified by traditional feature selection methods. Additionally, we contextualise this information by correlating dependence scores and model error with 15 socio-demographic variables such as ethnic distribution and social development. Our results show that social media activity related to COVID-19, tourism and leisure activities was associated most strongly with infection rates, indicated by high dependence scores up to 0.88. Mobility data consistently yielded low to intermediate dependence scores, with the maximum being 0.47. Our feature selection approach resulted in better or equivalent model performance when compared to traditional feature selection methods. At the health-area level, local feature selection generally yielded better model performance compared to city-wide feature selection. Finally, we observed that socio-demographic factors such as the proportion of the Indigenous population or social development correlated with the dependence scores of both mobility data and health- or leisure-related semantic topics on social media. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating localised multimodal features in city-level epidemiological analysis and offer a method for effectively identifying them. In the broader context of GeoAI, our approach provides a framework for identifying and ranking relevant spatiotemporal features, allowing for concrete insights prior to model building, and enabling more transparency when making predictions. © The Author(s) 2025.","Epidemiology; Feature selection; GeoAI; Mobility; Social media; Time series analysis","Feature selection methods; Features selection; GeoAI; Infection rates; Mobility; Modeling performance; Social development; Social media; Time series features; Time-series analysis; Time series","Springer","","","","","","27306852","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219621806"

Physics-based models are efficient but fail to capture nonlinear effects, while statistical methods require large datasets that are often impractical to collect in real manufacturing. Improving prediction accuracy under limited data conditions has thus become a critical issue. This study proposes a deep learning system framework that combines genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks (GA-NN). In addition to optimizing the prediction of warping parameters, the proposed GA-NN effectively improves the convergence speed and prediction accuracy. The SHapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is implemented into the neural network to improve the interpretability of the model. The conditional table generative adversarial network (CTGAN) is used for data augmentation and feedback application, combined with the search algorithm to complete the optimal parameter feedback. Experimental validation reveals that the presented methodology attains approximately 97.3% predictive accuracy in semiconductor package warpage estimation tasks, evidently surpassing conventional machine learning models, namely Random Forest (61.9%), SVR (68.7%), and baseline ANN configurations (90.0%). In contrast to prior methods, this study enhances computational throughput, predictive precision, and interpretable visualization correlating package design variables with deformation outcomes. Meanwhile, the proposed approach improves packaging warpage estimation processes, design cycle compression, and manufacturing-level product reliability elevation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Machine learning optimization; Prediction model interpretability; Product parameter feedback; Semiconductor packaging","Electronics packaging; Integrated circuit layout; Labels; Population statistics; Deep learning; Interpretability; Learning optimizations; Machine learning optimization; Machine-learning; Prediction model interpretability; Prediction modelling; Product parameter feedback; Product parameters; Semiconductor packaging; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005597928"

Since its implementation, the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) policy has significantly influenced haemodialysis services in hospitals, affecting patients' experiences. Material and Methods: Qualitative study. Twenty-two haemodialysis patients selected by snowball sampling from the Indonesian Dialysis Patient Community (Komunitas Pasien Cuci Darah Indonesia) participated. Data were collected through interviews, transcribed and analysed thematically, and psychological methods based on patients' experiences were used. Results: identified three main themes (health coverage system, haemodialysis services, haemodialysis facilities) and ten sub-themes (complex monthly payment situation for care recipients, unexpected deactivation of payment status, outdated referral system requirements, payment system complications for care recipients, penalty for late payments, disparities in services between hospitals, insufficient coverage for certain services, accessibility problems with distant haemodialysis units, variations in types of haemodialysis equipment, and inadequate comfort in the family waiting room). Conclusions: The health insurance system needs to be improved to increase access, equity, affordability, efficiency, consistency and quality of haemodialysis services in Indonesian hospitals.

This stems from their inherently stochastic, population-driven searches, which complicate the use of standard explainability techniques. In this article, we present a method to identify which decision variables have the greatest impact during an algorithm's trajectory from random initialsation to convergence. We apply Principal Component Analysis to project each population onto a lower-dimensional space, then introduce two metrics - Mean Variable Contribution and Proportion of Aligned Variables - to identify the variables most responsible for guiding the search. Using four different population-based methods (Particle Swarm Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) on 24 BBOB benchmark functions in 10 dimensions, we find that these metrics highlight meaningful variable relationships and provide a window into each method's search dynamics. By comparing the features extracted across algorithms and problems, we illustrate how certain variable subsets consistently drive major improvements in solution quality. In doing so, new evolutionary algorithm variants can be designed to take advantage of these influential variables, while also identifying underutilised variables that may benefit alternative search strategies.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Algorithm Trajectories; Evolutionary Algorithms; Population Diversity; Principal Component Analysis; Visualisation","Genetic algorithms; AI systems; Algorithm trajectory; Decision variables; Feature mining; Low-dimensional spaces; Metaheuristic; Population diversity; Principal Components; Principal-component analysis; Stochastic population; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","2688299X","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007020512"

However, the subsequent risk of clinical events in patients with coronary artery disease is not determined solely by lesion characteristics or how these lesions are treated. The current study investigated whether the effects of intravascular imaging in complex PCI vary according to atherothrombotic risks. Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of the RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI trial, which compared intravascular imaging-guided PCI with angiography-guided PCI in patients with complex coronary artery lesions. The study population was stratified by atherothrombotic risk, assessed using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score for secondary prevention (TRS-2P). TRS-2P is calculated based on the presence of the following factors: age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Patients were categorized into low-risk (TRS-2P < 3) or high-risk (TRS-2P ≥ 3) groups. The primary endpoint was target vessel failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Results: Among the total study population, 1247 patients were categorized as low-risk, and 392 as high-risk. The risk of target vessel failure was significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (15.5% vs 7.2%; HR, 2.13; 95%CI, 1.51-3.00; P < .001). The benefits of intravascular imaging-guided PCI over angiography-guided PCI did not differ between the low-risk group (5.6% vs 10.4%; HR, 0.56; 95%CI, 0.36-0.86) and the high-risk group (14.1% vs 18.5%; HR, 0.71; 95%CI, 0.41-1.24), with no significant interaction (interaction P = .496). Conclusions: In this hypothesis-generating post hoc analysis of the RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI trial, patients with high atherothrombotic risk had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with low atherothrombotic risk. Nevertheless, the prognostic impact of intravascular imaging-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI was similarly observed in both low- and high-risk groups.

Genetic Programming (GP) is one of the most interpretable machine learning algorithms currently available. While certain datasets necessitate complex GP models to capture underlying patterns, others may not require such complexity. However, GP lacks a mechanism to dynamically assess the required model complexity during evolution. As a result, GP often evolves overly complex models that are challenging to analyze, thereby reducing interpretability. This paper introduces a novel algorithm designed to evolve compact multi-objective GP models without significantly compromising regression error, thereby enhancing interpretability. The proposed method employs NSGA-II to simultaneously minimize regression error and maximize a newly introduced per-node importance metric. This metric quantifies the contribution of each node in terms of error reduction. By leveraging this metric, the algorithm discards large GP models containing many low-importance nodes, effectively avoiding unnecessarily complex solutions. Experimental results on ten regression datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently evolves smaller GP models with better interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance, particularly on high-dimensional datasets.  © 2025 IEEE.","Genetic Programming; Interpretability; NSGA-II; Per-node Importance; Regression","Artificial intelligence; Errors; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Genetic programming modeling; Interpretability; Multi objective; Node importance; NSGA-II; Per-node importance; Real-world; Regression; Regression errors; Symbolic regression; Genetic programming","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","","979-833153431-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010409296"

Although LLMs have demonstrated success in program synthesis, there remains a lack of trust in the generated code due to documented risks (e.g., code with known and risky vulnerabilities). Therefore, it is important to restrict the search space and avoid bad programs. In this work, pre-defined restricted Backus–Naur Form (BNF) grammars are utilised, which are considered ‘safe’, and the focus is on identifying the most effective technique for grammar-obeying program synthesis, where the generated code must be correct and conform to the predefined grammar. It is shown that while LLMs perform well in generating correct programs, they often fail to produce code that adheres to the grammar. To address this, a novel Similarity-Based Many-Objective Grammar Guided Genetic Programming (SBMaOG3P) approach is proposed, leveraging the programs generated by LLMs in two ways: (i) as seeds following a grammar mapping process and (ii) as targets for similarity measure objectives. Experiments on a well-known and widely used program synthesis dataset indicate that the proposed approach successfully improves the rate of grammar-obeying program synthesis compared to various LLMs and the state-of-the-art Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming. Additionally, the proposed approach significantly improved the solution in terms of the best fitness value of each run for 21 out of 28 problems compared to G3P. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Grammar; Grammar guided GP; LLMs; Multi-objective; Program synthesis","Context free grammars; Context sensitive grammars; Grammar; Grammar guided genetic programming; Grammar guided GP; Language model; Large language model; Multi objective; Program synthesis; Research interests; Search spaces; Two ways; Genetic programming","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09205489","","CSTIE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208936966"

This research introduces the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Explainer (MOGAE), a novel model-agnostic local explainer for image data aimed at the early detection of citrus diseases. MOGAE enhances eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) by leveraging the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with an adaptive Bit Flip Mutation (BFM) incorporating densify and sparsify operators to adjust superpixel granularity automatically. This innovative approach simplifies the explanation process by eliminating several critical hyperparameters required by traditional methods like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). To develop the citrus disease classification model, we preprocess the leaf dataset through stratified data splitting, oversampling, and augmentation techniques, then fine-tuning a pre-trained Residual Network 50 layers (ResNet50) model. MOGAE's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparative analyses with the Ensemble-based Genetic Algorithm Explainer (EGAE) and LIME, showing superior accuracy and interpretability using criteria such as numeric accuracy of explanation and Number of Function Evaluations (NFE). We assess accuracy both intuitively and numerically by measuring the Euclidean distance between expert-provided explanations and those generated by the explainer. The appendix also includes an extensive evaluation of MOGAE on the melanoma dataset, highlighting its versatility and robustness in other domains.

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a PSO-XGBoost fraud detection framework and uses explainable artificial intelligence to interpret the predictions. The framework combines an XGBoost classifier with the particle swarm optimization algorithm and is validated through a comparative evaluation against other models. Traditional methods, including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and BP Neural Network, demonstrate moderate accuracy, ranging from 54.1% to 68.6%, while more advanced models like Random Forest reach up to 78.4%. Compared to the standard XGBoost, the PSO-optimized model achieves 3% superior accuracy, achieving an impressive 95% success rate. Moreover, SHAP is used to extract and visually depict the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. It turns out that the policyholder's claim amount is the most significant factor in detecting automobile insurance fraud, with other factors such as vehicle type, responsible party, and the insurer's age also considerably influencing the prediction performance. This paper therefore proves that combining the PSO-XGBoost model with SHAP approach can substantially improve the early warning and prevention of automobile insurance fraud. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Automobile insurance; Fraud detection; PSO-XGBoost; SHAP","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01676687","","IMECD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209255636"

Contoured OARs included oral cavity (OC), floor of mouth (FoM), superior/middle constrictors (SMC), parotid glands (PG), submandibular glands (SMG), and tubarial glands (TG). OAR metrics were dichotomized at the median and in tertiles. The primary endpoints were 3- and 12-month PROs: the overall MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) and Dry Mouth (DM) and Sticky Saliva (SS) scores from the EORTC HN35. Results: The analysis includes 86 patients. The median mean doses were contralateral (CL, 15.7 Gy) and ipsilateral PG (26.3 Gy), contralateral SMG (35.3 Gy), OC (29.3 Gy), and SMC (47 Gy). OC, SMC and TG were significant predictors of 12-month MDADI, with a dose–response below the lowest tertile. Three-month DM scores were associated with OC doses, CL PG V15 and CL SMG V30, but only FoM and CL SMG V30 were predictors of 12 month DM. Oral cavity, FOM, and SMG doses were associated with 12 month SS outcomes. Conclusions: In a cohort of patients treated with de-escalated IMRT, the critical impact of OC and SMG doses became evident. More work is needed to understand both dosimetric and non-dosimetric predictors of long-term PROs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Head and neck cancer; IMRT; Patient-reported outcomes; Quality-of-life","carboplatin; cetuximab; cisplatin; paclitaxel; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; dosimetry; dry mouth score; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; female; human; major clinical study; male; md anderson dysphagia inventory; middle aged; oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma; parotid gland; patient-reported outcome; post hoc analysis; prospective study; radiation dose distribution; radiation dose escalation; radiation dose response; radiomics; retrospective study; sticky saliva score; submandibular gland; tubarial gland","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","01678140","","RAOND","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005798117"

However, the efficacy and consistency of LLMs still rely on the structure and quality of prompts (i.e., their input instructions). In real-world applications, the need for specialized prompt engineering, qualified staff, and domain knowledge often results in suboptimal performance and increased development costs. This paper explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in generating and optimizing prompts for LLMs, with the aim of enhancing their performance across various tasks tackled by diversely skilled teams. Here, we customize a standard GA implementation to work with textual individuals, which are initialized and manipulated by LLM-defined crossover and mutation operators to evolve candidate prompts. This approach enables the automated discovery of LLM-based solutions across a broad range of problems with minimal human effort. This process allows LLMs to achieve optimized outputs that are comparable to or even superior to those obtained through expert, costly labor. We test our approach on four modern LLMs by OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral, and four domain-specific problems. Our results demonstrate quantitative improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to human prompt engineers. Achieving an average accuracy 24% higher than that of manual crafted prompts, our results also prove the viability and potential of autonomous optimization tools to discover high-performing prompt configurations, reducing the need for extensive human intervention and trial-and-error methods.  © 2025 IEEE.","automated prompt engineering; Genetic Algorithms; LLM prompt optimization","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cost engineering; Genetic engineering; Automated prompt engineering; Development costs; Domain knowledge; Language model; Large language model prompt optimization; Optimisations; Performance; Real-world; Standard genetic algorithm; Sub-optimal performance; Genetic algorithms","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2025","8 June 2025 through 12 June 2025","Hangzhou","209964","","979-833153431-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010436801"

At its core, the attention mechanism remains an indispensable component of advanced Transformer architectures, with its significance and contributions widely acknowledged by the AI community. However, as research deepens and the demand for solving more complex real-world tasks increases, researchers have gradually identified bottlenecks in the self-attention mechanism, with some hypotheses validated through experimental observations. Despite these advances, current studies on the limitations of the self-attention mechanism are primarily centered on empirical observations and experimental results, lacking rigorous theoretical foundations. This gap has led to limited interpretability and unclear rationales behind some findings, despite their potential significance. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of the attention mechanism in Transformer models and provide an in-depth analysis of its capability bottleneck within the data-driven research paradigm. We identify a distinct capability boundary of the traditional attention mechanism and present a comprehensive theoretical analysis based on causal sampling theory. To validate our theoretical findings, we evaluate them in the context of the challenging task of Video Situation Recognition (VSR), obtaining experimental results that align with our theoretical conclusions. We hope that the findings of this study will inspire new perspectives on the capabilities of attention mechanisms and contribute positively to the development of optimization strategies in attention mechanism design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanism; Causal inference; Event extraction; Video content parsing","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Video recording; 'current; Attention mechanisms; Causal inferences; De-biasing; Events extractions; Performance; Real-world task; Transformer modeling; Video content parsing; Video contents; Article; artificial intelligence; causality; community; decision making; deep neural network; enzyme mechanism; generalization (psychology); human; hypothesis; knowledge; language model; process optimization; quantitative analysis; videorecording; Machine design","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09252312","","NRCGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009477627"

It is almost impossible to explain the large-scale RNN directly. A feasible method is to generalize the rules undermining it, that is, model abstraction. To deal with the low efficiency and excessive information loss in existing model abstraction for RNNs, this work proposes a PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-based model abstraction and explanation generation method for RNNs. Firstly, the k-means clustering is applied to preliminarily partition the RNN decision process state. Secondly, a frequency prefix tree is constructed based on the traces, and a PSO algorithm is designed to implement state merging to address the problem of vast state space. Then, a PFA (probabilistic finite automata) is constructed to explain the RNN structure with preserving the origin RNN information as much as possible. Finally, the quantitative keywords are labeled as an explanation for classification results, which are automatically generated with the abstract model PFA. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in some cases. © 2024 by the authors.","explanation; model abstraction; Particle Swarm Optimization; probabilistic finite automata; recurrent neural network","Abstracting; Classification (of information); Finite automata; K-means clustering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Text processing; Trees (mathematics); A-particles; Classifier models; Explanation; Model abstraction; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic finite automata; State-space; Swarm optimization; Text classifiers; Recurrent neural networks","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19994893","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194220668"

However, the unclear query statements of the detectors pose a challenge to the intelligent question answering task. Existing knowledge graph-based question-answering systems face issues of vocabulary limitations and reliance on fixed templates. Solely relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) for questioning introduces noise and randomness due to their extensive knowledge base. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach that synergistically employs both knowledge graphs and LLMs for intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection. The method divides the overall task into five units, progressively clarifying query statements for accurate answers. Leveraging LLM’s vast prior knowledge, robust semantic understanding, and contextual learning mitigates issues related to vocabulary limitations and template dependence. Simultaneously, the knowledge contained in the graph is integrated into an optimal clarification path and transferred to LLM to address noise and randomness, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the clarification process. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision, and Recall metrics all above 0.73. The results affirm the method’s effectiveness in improving the accuracy of intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection, with potential implications for similar applications in other domains of hydraulic engineering. © 2024 The Author(s).

Commonly, MR under different conditions of confining pressures and deviatoric stresses are tested by cyclic triaxial compressive experiments. However, such experiments are elaborate, expensive, and time-consuming, so developing more flexible and efficient approaches is imperative. This study investigates the potential application of a tree-based model termed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) on predicting MR. First, a dataset containing 891 samples of repeated load triaxial tests and the characteristics of subgrade soil is collected. Then, an XGBoost model, combined with a feature selection technique (Exhaustive Feature Selector (EFS)) and an optimization algorithm (Jellyfish Swarm Optimizer (JSO)), is trained on the collected dataset. EFS is used to identify the most suitable combinations of factors for MR prediction and JSO is applied to determine the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model, which aim to establish a robust XGBoost model with the best predictive capacity. Lastly, this study employs two advanced model interpretation techniques to identify the predominant factors affecting MR prediction based on the established XGBoost model. The results indicated that the EFS approach can effectively ascertain the best combination of factors for MR prediction; the JSO algorithm can effectively capture the optimal hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model; the resultant XGBoost model achieved a favorable capacity for MR prediction. Moreover, three primary factors affecting MR prediction are unveiled, which are the degree of soil saturation (Sr), confining stress (σ3), and plasticity index (PI). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Exhaustive feature selector; Extreme gradient boosting; Jellyfish swarm optimizer; Resilient modulus","algorithm; compression; confining pressure; flexure; heuristics; meta-analysis; optimization; pavement; plasticity; prediction; pressure effect; stress field; structural analysis; structural response; triaxial test","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22143912","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186195720"

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EVOPROMPT, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EVOPROMPT starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EVOPROMPT significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EVOPROMPT demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.

However, the surrogate of these SAEAs is underutilized to a large extent, which limits the search efficiency of these algorithms. To be specific, existing algorithms do not sufficiently exploit the estimated solution quality information from the surrogate models during offspring generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an SAEA framework named EXO-SAEA (EXplanation Operator based Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm). First, it divides the current population into two populations according to the a priori knowledge from the surrogate model. Then, for each solution in the first population, EXO-SAEA employs the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to estimate the contribution of each decision variable to the fitness values. After that, the Shapley values are then normalized for the offspring generation of the first population, while the second population uses generic GA operators. Two representative surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are used to instantiate the proposed framework. Experimental results on the synthetic benchmark problems and three real-world problems involving six state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Crossover operator; Expensive optimization; Explainable machine learning; Multi-objective optimization; Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm","Evolutionary algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Crossover operator; Expensive optimization; Explainable machine learning; Machine-learning; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Search efficiency; Surrogate modeling; Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm; Multiobjective optimization","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194762260"

Regional Flood frequency Analysis (RFFA) is one of the most commonly used approaches to estimate design floods in ungauged watersheds. This study used XGBoost coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to estimate different quantiles of the design floods with return periods (from 2-year to 1000-year). After a preliminary assessment, 373 nationwide hydrometric stations were selected to conduct at-site flood frequency analysis by identifying the best-fitting distribution. Using the capabilities of GIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE), 83 independent features including different physiographical, geomorphological, land-use, soil types, and long-term hydro-climatic and environmental variables were extracted for the upstream watersheds. After fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost method for each flood quantile, the feature importance values were used to eliminate the insignificant features and refine the developed models. Additionally, classical methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) were implemented, to evaluate the XGBoost models efficiency. Different statistics demonstrated that the models effectively estimated flood quantiles, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) varying from 0.709 to 0.840 across all models. A comparison of model performance reveals that the XGBoost method outperformed RF and SVR across all flood quantiles. Based on the developed models, design floods have been estimated for 949 stations across Iran. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were used to identify the main contributing features to model outputs and investigate the spatial heterogeneity of main flood drivers. According to the results, the perimeter and length of the watershed and heavy rainfall exhibit notably high importance compared to other features for all models. Based on the local SHAP values, in Northern, Northwestern, and Western basins, features associated with watershed sizes, such as perimeter, area and length exhibit the highest levels of importance. Moreover, the Southwest basins are more influenced by “heavy rainfall”. These findings demonstrate the promise of the developed models for estimating flood quantiles across diverse environmental, geomorphological, and hydro-climatic conditions. This capability is valuable for sustainable watershed management, especially in environments with limited maximum discharge data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Flood drivers; Google Earth Engine; Regional flood frequency analysis; SHAP; Spatial heterogeneity; XGBoost","Iran; Efficiency; Engines; Forestry; Land use; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Support vector machines; Watersheds; Design flood; Flood driver; Flood quantiles; Google earth engine; Google earths; Regional flood frequency analysis; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Spatial heterogeneity; Xgboost; exploration; flood frequency; frequency analysis; GIS; heterogeneity; hydrological modeling; peak discharge; rainfall; watershed; Floods","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00221694","","JHYDA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196004354"

We discovered SML optimal pipelines with competitive performance and up to 70 times less carbon emissions than hybrid or fully LLM pipelines, such as standard BERT and DistilBERT variants. Similarly, we obtain hybrid pipelines (using SML and LLMs) with between 20% and 50% reduced carbon emissions compared to fine-tuned alternatives and only a marginal decrease in performance.

Instead, the evaluation of the knowledge that these models have of the languages has received much less attention. For example, the words that they can recognize and use in different languages. In this paper, we evaluate the knowledge that open chat LLMs have of Spanish words by testing a sample of words in a reference dictionary. The results show that open chat LLMs produce incorrect meanings for an important fraction of the words and are not able to use most of the words correctly to write sentences with context.

While there are already some sample reweighting methods based on Marginal Structural Model for eliminating the confounding bias, they generally focus on removing the treatment’s linear dependence on confounders and rely on the accuracy of the assumed parametric models, which are usually unverifiable. In this paper, we propose a de-confounding representation learning (DRL) framework for counterfactual outcome estimation of continuous treatment by generating the representations of covariates decorrelated with the treatment variables. The DRL is a non-parametric model that eliminates both linear and nonlinear dependence between treatment and covariates. Specifically, we train the correlations between the de-confounding representations and the treatment variables against the correlations between the covariate representations and the treatment variables to eliminate confounding bias. Further, a counterfactual inference network is embedded into the framework to make the learned representations serve both de-confounding and trusted inference. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that the DRL model performs superiorly in learning de-confounding representations and outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual inference models for continuous treatment variables. In addition, we apply the DRL model to a real-world medical dataset MIMIC III and demonstrate a detailed causal relationship between red cell width distribution and mortality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Adversarial Network; Continuous Treatment; Counterfactual Inference; De-confounding Representation","Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Causal inferences; Continuous treatments; Counterfactual inference; Counterfactuals; Covariates; De-confounding representation; Learning models; Linear dependence; Real-world; Generative adversarial networks","Springer","","","","","","13845810","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198053709"

Therefore, determining the best care for a patient is hard. Currently, if no significant tumor growth is observed, treatment is often delayed, as treatment itself is not without risk. However, by doing so, the risk of (irreversible) adverse effects due to tumor growth may increase. Being able to predict the growth accurately could assist in determining whether a patient will need treatment during their lifetime and, if so, the timing of this treatment. The aim of this work is to learn the general underlying growth pattern of paragangliomas from multiple tumor growth data sets, in which each data set contains a tumor's volume over time. To do so, we propose a novel approach based on genetic programming to learn a function class, i.e., a parameterized function that can be fit anew for each tumor. We do so in a unique, multi-modal, multi-objective fashion to find multiple potentially interesting function classes in a single run. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic and a real-world data set. By analyzing the resulting function classes, we can effectively explain the general patterns in the data. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

High Energy Phys. JHEP05(2023)015), we showed that the strictly massless spin-3/2 field, as well as the strictly and partially massless spin-5/2 fields, on N-dimensional ( N ⩾ 3 ) de Sitter (dS) spacetime (dS N ) are non-unitary unless N = 4. The (non-)unitarity was demonstrated by simply observing that there is a (mis-)match between the representation-theoretic labels that correspond to the unitary irreducible representations (UIR’s) of the dS algebra spin ( N , 1 ) and the ones corresponding to the space of eigenmodes of the field theories. In this paper, we provide a technical representation-theoretic explanation for this fact by studying the (non-)existence of positive-definite, dS invariant scalar products for the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 strictly/partially massless eigenmodes on dS N  ( N ⩾ 3 ). Our basic tool is the examination of the action of spin ( N , 1 ) generators on the space of eigenmodes, leading to the following findings. For odd N, any dS invariant scalar product is identically zero. For even N > 4, any dS invariant scalar product must be indefinite. This gives rise to positive-norm and negative-norm eigenmodes that mix with each other under spin ( N , 1 ) boosts. In the N = 4 case, the positive-norm sector decouples from the negative-norm sector and each sector separately forms a UIR of spin(4, 1).

Hence, early detection and timely treatment of this disease are significant to prevent the coronavirus's spread and ensure more effective patient care. This work adopted an integrated framework comprising deep learning and attention mechanism to provide a more effective and reliable diagnosis. This framework consists of two convolution neural network (CNN), a bidirectional LSTM, two fully-connected layers (FCL), and an attention mechanism. The main aim of the proposed framework is to reveal a promising approach based on deep learning for early and timely detection of coronavirus disease. For greater accuracy, the framework's hyperparameters are tuned by means of a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been examined utilizing a public dataset including 18 different blood findings from Albert Einstein Israelita Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Additionally, within the experimental studies, the proposed framework is subjected to comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, evaluated across various metrics. Based on the derived consequences, the proposed framework has yielded enhancements in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, registering approximate improvements of 1.27%, 4.07%, 3.20%, and 2.88%, respectively, as measured against the second-best rates. © The Author(s) 2024.","Attention mechanism; Coronavirus disease; Deep learning; Detection; Genetic algorithm","Diagnosis; Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Health risks; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Patient treatment; Attention mechanisms; Convolution neural network; Coronavirus disease; Coronaviruses; Daily lives; Deep learning; Detection; Integrated frameworks; Learning mechanism; Patient care; Coronavirus","Springer","","","","","","13807501","","MTAPF","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186855905"

Despite extensive research, effective antiviral therapies are still limited. To address this urgent need, we present AVP-GPT2, a deep-learning model that significantly outperforms its predecessor, AVP-GPT, in designing and screening antiviral peptides. Trained on a significantly expanded dataset, AVP-GPT2 employs a transformer-based architecture to generate diverse peptide sequences. A multi-modal screening approach, incorporating Star-Transformer and Vision Transformer, enables accurate prediction of antiviral activity and toxicity, leading to the identification of potent and safe candidates. SHAP analysis further enhances interpretability by explaining the underlying mechanisms of peptide activity. Our in vitro experiments confirmed the antiviral efficacy of peptides generated by AVP-GPT2, with some exhibiting EC50 values as low as 0.01 μM and CC50 values > 30 μM. This represents a substantial improvement over AVP-GPT and traditional methods. AVP-GPT2 has the potential to significantly impact antiviral drug discovery by accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic agents. Future research will explore its application to other viral targets and its integration into existing drug development pipelines. © 2024 by the authors.","antiviral activity screening model; antiviral peptide; generation model; SHAP; star-transformer; toxicity screening model; vision-transformer","Antiviral Agents; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Peptides; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; antiviral peptide; peptide; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; peptide; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; analysis; antiviral activity; Article; AVP GPT2 platform; cell viability assay; Coronaviridae; cytotoxicity; evaluation study; frequency analysis; Hepatitis C virus; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human respiratory syncytial virus; in vitro study; Influenza virus; information processing; nonhuman; physicochemical model; random forest; screening; software; structure analysis; support vector machine; toxicity; ultra performance liquid chromatography; chemistry; drug development; drug effect; drug therapy; human; preclinical study; procedures; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virology","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19994915","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216077868"

Genetic programming (GP) has been used to obtain interpretable ML models because it operates at the level of functional building blocks: if these building blocks are interpretable, there is a chance that their composition (i.e., the entire ML model) is also interpretable. However, the degree to which a model is interpretable depends on the observer. Motivated by this, we study a recently-introduced human-in-The-loop system that allows the user to steer GP's generation process to their preferences, which shall be online-learned by an artificial neural network (ANN). We focus on the generation of ML models as analytical functions (i.e., symbolic regression) as this is a key problem in interpretable ML, and propose a two-fold contribution. First, we devise more general representations for the ML models for the ANN to learn upon, to enable the application of the system to a wider range of problems. Second, we delve into a deeper analysis of the system's components. To this end, we propose an incremental experimental evaluation, aimed at (1) studying the effectiveness by which an ANN can capture the perceived interpretability for simulated users, (2) investigating how the GP's outcome is affected across different simulated user feedback profiles, and (3) determining whether humans participants would prefer models that were generated with or without their involvement. Our results pose clarity on pros and cons of using a human-in-The-loop approach to discover interpretable ML models with GP. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, lack of interpretability, and ethical concerns persist. This study addresses these gaps by developing an interpretable AI model to predict snack choices in a controlled laboratory experiment. Method: a random forest classifier was trained to predict participants’ snack choices (healthy vs. unhealthy) based on contextual factors (hunger, mood, time of day) and historical choices. Data were collected from 75 adults over 10 sessions, with features engineered to capture both immediate and longitudinal patterns. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance analysis. Results: the model achieved 85,33 % accuracy, with hunger level, historical choices, and mood identified as the most influential predictors. Performance improved over sessions (peaking at 93,33 % accuracy in sessions 8–9), highlighting the value of longitudinal data. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across age, gender, and BMI, with higher accuracy for participants with healthier habits and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: this study demonstrates the feasibility of interpretable AI models in predicting dietary behavior while addressing ethical concerns through rigorous data anonymization and informed consent protocols. The findings underscore the potential of AI to inform personalized interventions for healthier eating habits and provide a framework for ethical AI implementation in behavioral research. © 2025; Los autores.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Behavioral Prediction; Ethical AI; Interpretability; Random Forest Classifier; Snack Choice","","AG Editor (Uruguay)","","","","","","3046403X","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006826981"

However, these methods can be slow for time-critical applications due to the iterative stochastic processes they perform. This problem becomes even more pronounced in dynamic environments such as cloud systems. This paper proposes an interpretable rule-based solution to minimize this problem. Combining metaheuristic task scheduling solutions and machine learning techniques, this method uses a two-phase mechanism, semi-offline and online. In the semi-offline phase, we first archive metaheuristic solutions to previously randomly generated or encountered task-scheduling problems. The basic idea of the proposed method is to reuse these previously obtained successful metaheuristic solution patterns for future similar problems. Finding similar solution patterns from this extensive archive dataset is done by automatically extracting rule sets through machine learning techniques. These interpretable rule sets are used to identify the type of task scheduling problem encountered in the online phase and to find the optimal solution pattern. The performance of this method, which dramatically reduces execution time and enables the use of metaheuristics in time-critical applications, has been tested and proven for various cloud task-scheduling scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Metaheuristic; Rule-based algorithm; Task scheduling","Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multitasking; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic systems; Cloud systems; Cloud-computing; Interpretable rules; Machine learning techniques; Metaheuristic; Rule based; Rule based algorithms; Solution patterns; Tasks scheduling; Time-critical applications; Random processes","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180999062"

To effectively monitor and combat this problem, accurate predictive models are essential. This research focused on employing machine learning (ML) techniques to construct some models for analyzing the adsorption capacity of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic from contaminated water. The robustness of ten machine learning algorithms was evaluated using performance metrics such as the Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Square Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The hyperparameters of the ML models were fine-tuned using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The optimized models were comprehensively evaluated using feature importance analysis to quantify the relative significance of operational variables accurately. After a thorough assessment and comparison of various machine learning models, it was evident that the HistGradientBoosting (HGB) model outperformed others in terms of CIP adsorption performance. This was supported by their low MAE value of 0.1865 and high R2 value of 0.9999. The modeling projected the highest antibiotic adsorption (99.28%) under optimized conditions, including 10 mg/L of CIP, 357 mg/L of CuWO4@TiO2 adsorbent, a contact time of 60 min at room temperature, and near neutral pH (7.5). The combination of advanced ML algorithms and nano adsorbents has great potential for addressing the problem of antibiotic pollution in water sources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian optimization; Ciprofloxacin adsorption; Gradient Boosting; Machine learning; Nano adsorbent","Adsorption; Algorithms; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bayes Theorem; Ciprofloxacin; Machine Learning; Water Pollutants, Chemical; adsorbent; ciprofloxacin; water; antiinfective agent; Bayesian optimization; Ciprofloxacin adsorption; Gradient boosting; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mean absolute error; Metaheuristic; Nano adsorbents; Water source; adsorption; algorithm; antibiotics; Bayesian analysis; machine learning; nanotechnology; optimization; adsorption; Article; Bayes theorem; comparative study; contact time; correlation coefficient; decision tree; descriptive research; explainable machine learning; mean absolute error; mean squared error; metaheuristics; prediction; random forest; root mean squared error; waste water management; water contamination; water supply; adsorption; algorithm; chemistry; machine learning; water pollutant; Contrastive Learning","Academic Press","","","","","","03014797","","JEVMA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205718817"

Objective: The aim of this research work is to addresses the issue of noise reduction and to predict Alzheimer's disease detection efficiently. Methods: First, we present a genetic programming (GP) technique for reducing Rician noise in MRI images to pre-process the dataset. To effectively reduce Rician noise, this GP approach combines a Feature Extraction component, GP Optimal Expression, and an Optimum Removal Estimation component. In the second phase, we design and develop an explainable Deep Learning framework. This framework uses a local data-driven interpretation technique based on SHAP values to investigate the relationship between the neural network's estimated AD diagnosis and the input MRI images. In addition, we handle class distribution by combining an oversampling strategy with a minority approach. Several assessment metrics are used to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Results: The proposed method is tested on a variety of medical samples, and the results are compared to those obtained using other comparable approaches. We also test and compare our model to three cutting-edge models: DenseNet169, VGGNet15, and Inceptionv3. Conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed model outperforms others, particularly in handling basic structures with limited spectral features, lower computational complexity, and less overfitting.

However, recently researchers have demonstrated that previous approaches are severely limited in out-of-distribution generalization, thus proposing the De-biased TSG challenge which requires models to overcome weakness towards outlier test samples. In this paper, we design a novel framework, termed Counterfactually-Augmented Event Matching (CAEM), which incorporates counterfactual data augmentation to learn event-query joint representations to resist the training bias. Specifically, it consists of three components: (1) A Temporal Counterfactual Augmentation module that generates counterfactual video-text pairs by temporally delaying events in the untrimmed video, enhancing the model's capacity for counterfactual thinking. (2) An Event-Query Matching model that is used to learn joint representations and predict corresponding matching scores for each event candidate. (3) A Counterfact-Adaptive Framework (CAF) that incorporates the counterfactual consistency rules on the matching process of the same event-query pairs, furtherly mitigating the bias learned from training sets. We conduct thorough experiments on two widely used DTSG datasets, i.e., Charades-CD and ActivityNet-CD, to evaluate our proposed CAEM method.

However, due to geographical and socio-economic constraints in these regions, flood-related sample data are generally scarce. This study introduces a Mean Filter (MF) grounded in the point-area duality perspective, combined with a feature selection approach utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms. Three such algorithms (NSGA-II, SPEA2, and NSPSO) were applied to generate the Pareto front of flood susceptibility features, followed by a comprehensive evaluation using the CRITIC-TOPSIS method. The results show that NSGA-II performed best in terms of Hypervolume, Spacing, Generational Distance, and the number of Pareto solutions. The selected feature subsets demonstrated improvements across multiple model validations, with the GB model achieving the highest overall performance and stability. Notably, half of the retained features are related to buffer zone and watershed characteristics, and the SHAP analysis indicates that the mean Topographic Wetness Index within the 50-m buffer zone is the main contributor to flood risk. This finding validates the effectiveness of the MF strategy based on the point-area duality perspective under limited sample conditions, offering a new approach for flood studies with sparse data in mountainous regions. © 2024","Feature selection; Flood risk; Machine learning; Mountainous settlements; SHapley Additive exPlanations","Algorithms; Climate Change; Floods; Models, Theoretical; Pareto principle; Risk assessment; Buffer zones; Features selection; Flood risks; Global climate changes; Machine-learning; Mean filter; Mountainous settlement; NSGA-II; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; buffer zone; climate change; flood control; machine learning; optimization; watershed; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; Bayesian learning; climate change; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; disaster; feature selection; flooding; genetic algorithm; global climate; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; mountain; multilayer perceptron; multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; multiobjective optimization; particle swarm optimization; performance indicator; precipitation; random forest; risk; risk assessment; risk management; Shapley additive explanation; soil moisture; support vector machine; surface property; surface runoff; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; topography; watershed; algorithm; climate change; theoretical model; Multiobjective optimization","Academic Press","","","","","","03014797","","JEVMA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214214263"

In the study reported here, we aimed to determine the overall 52-week cumulative clinical benefit of treatment initiated with deucravacitinib versus apremilast and to compare the 52-week cumulative benefit of initiating and staying on deucravacitinib versus initiating apremilast and continuing or switching to deucravacitinib at week 24 of treatment. Methods: This post hoc analysis of POETYK PSO-1 data (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03624127) determined the cumulative clinical benefit of deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily and apremilast 30 mg twice daily in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with apremilast who did not achieve a 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 24 were switched to deucravacitinib. The cumulative clinical benefit of deucravacitinib versus apremilast over 52 weeks was based on cumulative measures of ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in PASI score (PASI 75) and the proportion of patients with a static Physician Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (sPGA 0/1). Ratios of area under the curve estimates between treatments were calculated and compared based on analysis of covariance regression models. Results: Patients initiating deucravacitinib (N = 332) had a greater cumulative benefit as measured by the PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 than those initiating apremilast (N = 168). Over 52 weeks, those initiating deucravacitinib experienced 50% more benefit as measured by PASI 75 and 58% more benefit as measured by sPGA 0/1 than those initiating apremilast. Results were consistent with the primary analysis when patients were classified by prior systemic and prior biologic therapy exposure. Conclusion: Results from this analysis corroborate the primary efficacy analysis supporting the use of deucravacitinib compared with apremilast for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, regardless of prior systemic or biologic use. © The Author(s) 2024.","Apremilast, cumulative clinical benefit; Deucravacitinib; Oral treatments; Psoriasis; Small molecules","apremilast; deucravacitinib; adult; area under the curve; Article; biological therapy; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient coding; post hoc analysis; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; static physician global assessment score; study design; systemic therapy; treatment outcome","Adis","","","","","","21938210","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196648423"

Despite numerous successful applications, several studies have shown that the NSGA-II is less effective for larger numbers of objectives. In this work, we use mathematical runtime analyses to rigorously demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon. We show that even on the simple m-objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in sub-exponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently. This is not a problem for two objectives, where any sorting of a pair-wise incomparable set of solutions according to one objective is also such a sorting according to the other objective (in the inverse order).This paper for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2024 summarizes the work Weijie Zheng, Benjamin Doerr: Runtime Analysis for the NSGA-II: Proving, Quantifying, and Explaining the Inefficiency For Many Objectives.

However, finding the information users need from this vast data has become challenging. To tackle this problem, recommending preferred information to users is becoming increasingly important. However, accurately recommending information by analyzing existing models such as GraphRec is still a challenging problem. A method called PSO_KFCM is proposed in this paper to solve this problem better. The technique combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with hybrid optimization and the kernel fuzzy C-means clustering technique to cluster similar recommendation data into one class. This way, the complexity and randomness of the recommendation data are reduced. It improves the speed and accuracy of the model prediction, which lays a solid foundation for the subsequent recommendation. Various factors will impact the recommendation process, and channel and spatial characteristics are essential. CBAM attention is added to the original attention mechanism to fully utilize these features in the recommendation data to enhance its performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a social recommendation prediction method that combines CBAM attention and PSO_KFCM clustering and introduces a new social model called TTYGNN. The TTYGNN model optimizes the recommendation effect while maintaining the original advantages, enabling users to obtain the required information more quickly and accurately. To verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model, extensive experimental comparisons were conducted on two widely used datasets.

The combination of LS and GP aims to produce an interpretable control law as similar as possible to the optimal control scheme reference. Inclusive Genetic Programming (IGP), a GP heuristic capable of promoting and maintaining the population diversity, is chosen as the GP algorithm since it proved successful on the considered task. IGP is enhanced with the Operators Gradient Descent (OPGD) approach, which consists of embedding learnable parameters into the GP individuals. These parameters are optimized during and after the evolutionary process. Moreover, the OPGD approach is combined with the adjoint state method to evaluate the gradient of the objective function. The original OPGD was formulated by relying on the backpropagation technique for the gradient's evaluation, which is impractical in an optimization problem involving a dynamical system because of scalability and numerical errors. On the other hand, the adjoint method allows for overcoming this issue. Two experiments are formulated to test the proposed approach, named Operator Gradient Descent - Inclusive Genetic Programming (OPGD-IGP): the design of a Proportional–Derivative (PD) control law for a harmonic oscillator and the design of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control law for an inverted pendulum on a cart. OPGD-IGP proved successful in both experiments, being capable of autonomously designing an interpretable control law similar to the optimal ones, both in terms of shape and control gains. © 2024 The Author(s)","Adjoint state method; Control; Genetic Programming; Gradient descent","Control theory; Dynamical systems; Genetic algorithms; Gradient methods; Inverted pendulum; Adjoint state method; Adjoints; Automatic design; Control laws; Control schemes; Design tasks; Genetic programming algorithms; Gradient-descent; Local search; Scheme design; Genetic programming","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192055473"

Once learners do not have sufficient understanding of knowledge association or do not implement the topological order of knowledge advancement, they are prone to burnout in the learning process, forming serious negative emotions, which is not conducive to learning effectiveness, and even premature dropout. This is clearly a psychological teaching problem, that is our research objectives. This study focuses on the STEM learning behaviors in MOOCs, and explores the deep learning routing. We design one novel method to process the context features and content features for knowledge concept recommendation. Multiple entities, features, and courses enable the construction and optimization of knowledge concept relationships. Then, an attention mechanism is used to achieve the knowledge concept propagation between different entities. The extensive experiments have proved this method might accurately capture potential interests of knowledge concepts, achieve the effective deep learning routing, and explore and guide the positive learning state, reduce or avoid the negative psychological outcomes, such as dropout or low pass rate. The entire study aims to enhance learning outcomes, improve learning motivation, optimize learning behaviors, and provide more effective suggestions for STEM education, that is very important for the interdisciplinary learning in higher education.

As industries continue to adopt these methods in areas that increasingly require end-user input and confirmation, the need to explain the internal decisions being made has grown. In this article, we present our approach to the extraction of explanation supporting features using trajectory mining. This is achieved through the application of principal components analysis techniques to identify new methods of tracking population diversity changes post-runtime. The algorithm search trajectories were generated by solving a set of benchmark problems with a genetic algorithm and a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm and retaining all visited candidate solutions which were then projected to a lower dimensional sub-space. We also varied the selection pressure placed on high fitness solutions by altering the selection operators. Our results show that metrics derived from the projected sub-space algorithm search trajectories are capable of capturing key learning steps and how solution variable patterns that explain the fitness function may be captured in the principal component coefficients. A comparative study of variable importance rankings derived from a surrogate model built on the same dataset was also performed. The results show that both approaches are capable of identifying key features regarding variable interactions and their influence on fitness in a complimentary fashion. © 2023 The Authors.

Traditional screening methods, including mammography, MRI, ultrasound, and biopsies, while effective, often come with high costs and risks. Recently, thermal imaging has gained attention due to its minimal risks compared to mammography, although it is not widely adopted as a primary detection tool since it depends on identifying skin temperature changes and lesions. The advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has enhanced the effectiveness of breast cancer detection and diagnosis using this technology. In this study, a novel interpretable computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for breast cancer detection is proposed, leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) throughout its various phases. To achieve these goals, we proposed a new multi-objective optimization approach named the Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (HPSO) and Hybrid Spider Monkey Optimization algorithm (HSMO). These algorithms simultaneously combined the continuous and binary representations of PSO and SMO to effectively manage trade-offs between accuracy, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. We evaluated several CAD models and investigated the impact of handcrafted methods such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Gabor Filters, and Edge Detection. We further shed light on the effect of feature selection and optimization on feature attribution and model decision-making processes using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework, with a particular emphasis on cancer classification using the DMR-IR dataset. The results of our experiments demonstrate in all trials that the performance of the model is improved. With HSMO, our models achieved an accuracy of 98.27% and F1-score of 98.15% while selecting only 25.78% of the HOG features. This approach not only boosts the performance of CAD models but also ensures comprehensive interpretability. This method emerges as a promising and transparent tool for early breast cancer diagnosis. © 2024 by the authors.","binary; breast cancer detection; continuous; feature attribution; feature extraction; feature selection; HPSO; HSMO; hyperparameter tuning; multi-objective optimization; thermography; XAI","Diseases; Feature Selection; Gabor filters; Lung cancer; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammography; Oncology; Screening; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Ultrasonic imaging; Binary; Breast cancer detection; Continuous; Feature attribution; Features extraction; Features selection; Hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm; Hybrid spider monkey optimization algorithm; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Thermography; XAI; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19994893","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207635177"

Fixed and max-pressure methods are commonly used in TSC systems owing to their high simplicity and good interpretability, but they respectively lack dynamic adaptability and automatic rule generation, possibly leading to low solution accuracy in complicated traffic environments. Meanwhile, meta-heuristic and black-box learning methods meet challenges in practice such as extensive computational time and poor interpretability. To this end, this paper proposes a new TSC method based on Genetic Programming (GP) to generate descriptive score rules automatically for switching phases of all signalized intersections in an urban transportation network. In the proposed method, switching phases of each signalized intersection type is formulated as a symbolic regression problem, and effective primitives are defined to facilitate GP to solve the problem. Experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks. The results have validated the effectiveness of our proposed GP based method compared to several state-of-the-art TSC methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability. © 2024","Genetic programming; Symbolic regression; Traffic signal control","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Traffic signals; Urban transportation; Control methods; Interpretability; Number of vehicles; Pressure methods; Signalized intersection; Symbolic regression; Traffic signal control; Traffic signal control system; Urban areas; Urban networks; Genetic programming","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192989951"

Accurate and timely assessment of rockburst risk can avoid unnecessary casualties and property losses. Despite the existence of various methods for rockburst assessment, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive and reliable criterion that is easy to both apply and interpret. Developing a new rockburst criterion based on simple parameters can potentially fill this gap. With its advantages, this criterion can facilitate a more effective and efficient prediction of rockburst potential, thereby contributing significantly to enhancing safety measures. In this paper, combined with the internal and external factors of rockburst, four control variables (i.e., integrity index, stress index, brittleness index, and elastic energy index) were selected to be incorporated into a comprehensive rockburstability index (RBSI). Based on 116 sets of rockburst cases, the rockburst potential was accurately quantified and predicted using the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model and the nature-inspired metaheuristic African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA). In its performance validation, the criterion achieved the highest accuracy of 90.48%, verifying the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed RBSI criterion. Additionally, an interpretive method was applied to analyze the variable influence on the criterion, facilitating the explanation of predictions and the analysis of the formula's robustness under different conditions. In general, compared with existing criterion methods involving relevant indicators, the newly proposed RBSI criterion enhances the accuracy of rockburst potential prediction, and it can effectively and swiftly evaluate the preliminary risk of rockburst. Lastly, a graphical user interface was developed to provide a clear visualization of the assessment of rockburst potential. © 2024","CatBoost; Graphical user interface; Metaheuristic optimization; Model interpretation; Rockburst criterion","Biomimetics; Forecasting; Fracture mechanics; Optimization; Risk assessment; Underground structures; Categorical boosting; Great depth; Hard rocks; Meta-heuristic techniques; Metaheuristic optimization; Model interpretations; Prediction criterions; Rock engineering; Rockburst criteria; Rockburst prediction; algorithm; hard rock; modeling; risk assessment; rockburst; software; Graphical user interfaces","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","20962754","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196952034"

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the sophisticated mechanism of autophagy can solely contribute to the knowledge of side effects, drug repurposing, and the development of novel poly-pharmacological strategies regarding autophagy-related diseases. Artificial intelligence approaches' broad applicability in system biology has been a promising method in identifying the autophagy-related (Art) protein, which is vitally important to regulate and control various stages of autophagy formation. Underlying explainable XGBoost and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) models, the important features and predictive model of Art protein were established. Consequently, our model performance achieved a sensitivity of 66.52 %, specificity of 82.77 %, accuracy of 77.32 %, and MCC of 0.430 via a 5-fold cross-validation evaluation. Moreover, we evaluated our model on an independent dataset, and the final results reached a sensitivity of 65.1 %, specificity of 79.1 %, and accuracy of 77.1 %. It is then observed that our model was efficient and strongly recommended for further analysis of physiological mechanisms and the development of drugs regarding autophagy.

Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Ensemble learning; Finishing; Interpretable machine learning; Polishing; Surface roughness prediction; Ultra-precision machining","Costs; Deep learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Jets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Polishing; Regression analysis; Abrasive waterjets; Differential evolution algorithms; Ensemble learning; Interpretable machine learning; Jet polishing; Machine-learning; Prediction accuracy; Roughness predictions; Surface roughness prediction; Ultraprecision machining; Surface roughness","Springer","","","","","","09565515","","JIMNE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165252925"

Coyoacán, Mexico, 04510, Mexico","In developing a theory of consciousness, one of the main problems has to do with determining what distinguishes conscious states from non-conscious ones—the delimitation problem. This paper explores the possibility of solving this problem in terms of self-awareness. That self-awareness is essential to understanding the nature of our conscious experience is perhaps the most widely discussed hypothesis in the study of consciousness throughout the history of philosophy. Its plausibility hinges on how the notion of self-awareness is unpacked. The idea that consciousness involves self-awareness has been understood in two different ways: either as awareness of oneself—the subject of experience—or as awareness of the conscious episode itself. In this paper I argue (i) that every experience concerns the subject in a very specific way, involving what I will call ‘perspectival de se representation’, and (ii) that there is no need to appeal to the experience itself in order to characterize the awareness within that experience. The view I articulate explains the subjective nature of experience without over-intellectualizing it, accommodates the phenomenology of experience, and dispels any doubt about the need to find the self in introspection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","01650106","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130821010"

However, antibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a Pre-trained Antibody generative large Language Model (PALM-H3) for the de novo generation of artificial antibodies heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) with desired antigen-binding specificity, reducing the reliance on natural antibodies. We also build a high-precision model antigen-antibody binder (A2binder) that pairs antigen epitope sequences with antibody sequences to predict binding specificity and affinity. PALM-H3-generated antibodies exhibit binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the emerging XBB variant, as confirmed through in-silico analysis and in-vitro assays. The in-vitro assays validate that PALM-H3-generated antibodies achieve high binding affinity and potent neutralization capability against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and the emerging XBB variant. Meanwhile, A2binder demonstrates exceptional predictive performance on binding specificity for various epitopes and variants. Furthermore, by incorporating the attention mechanism inherent in the Roformer architecture into the PALM-H3 model, we improve its interpretability, providing crucial insights into the fundamental principles of antibody design. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Artificial Intelligence; Complementarity Determining Regions; COVID-19; Epitopes; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Delta; Nigeria; complementarity determining region 3; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; immunoglobulin heavy chain; SARS-CoV-2 antibody; unclassified drug; virus antigen; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; neutralizing antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; antibody; antigen; architecture; language; neutralization; severe acute respiratory syndrome; antibody production; antigen binding; antigen specificity; Article; binding affinity; computer model; controlled study; human; in vitro study; large language model; mouse; nonhuman; rat; SARS-CoV-2 Alpha; SARS-CoV-2 Delta; SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1 (isolate hCoV-19/South Korea/KDCA43428/2022); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus neutralization; wild type; artificial intelligence; chemistry; complementarity determining region; coronavirus disease 2019; genetics; immunology; virology","Nature Research","","","","","","20411723","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200970034"

Nevertheless, the majority of AI models employed in this context were characterized by a lack of transparency. To address these concerns, we aim to design an interpretable tool to automate human embryo evaluation by combining artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 223 human blastocyst time-lapse (TL) images taken at 110 hours post-injection. All the images were evaluated by five embryologists from different clinics in terms of blastocyst expansion (BE), quality of the inner cell mass (ICM), and trophectoderm (TE). The embryo database was used to develop an AI system (70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test) for automate blastocyst assessment. The entire set of images underwent a standardization process, followed by processing and segmentation using Matlab software. The resulting quantified variables were utilized in AI techniques (ANN and GA). Finally, the accuracy and performance of the automation tool was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Then, the level of agreement among embryologists and between embryologists and the AI system was compared with Kappa Index. Results: The overall agreement among embryologists was low (Kappa: 0.4 for BE; and 0.3 for TE and ICM). The AI tool achieved higher consistency (Kappa 0.7 for BE and ICM; and 0.4 for TE). The AI exhibited high accuracy in classifying BE (test 81.5%), ICM (test 78.8%), and TE (test 78.3%) and better performance for BE (AUC 0.888-0.956) than for ICM (AUC 0.605-0.854) and TE (AUC 0.726-0.769) assessment. Conclusion: Our AI tool highlighted the superior consistency of AI compared to human operators in grading blastocyst morphology.

These CtB-LLMs are democratizing access to trainable Very Large-Language Models (VLLMs) and, thus, may represent the building blocks of many NLP systems solving downstream tasks. Hence, a little or a large bias in CtB-LLMs may cause significant harm. In this paper, we performed a large investigation of the bias of three families of CtB-LLMs, and we showed that debiasing techniques are effective and usable. Indeed, according to current tests, the LLaMA and the OPT families have an important bias in gender, race, religion, and profession. In contrast to the analysis for other LLMs, we discovered that bias depends not on the number of parameters but on the perplexity. Finally, the debiasing of OPT using LoRA reduces bias up to 4.12 points in the normalized stereotype score. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Building blockes; Current test; De-biasing; Down-stream; Language model; Language processing; Natural language understanding; NLP systems; Significant harm; System solving","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","SIGLEX - ACL Special Interest Group","13th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, StarSEM 2024","20 June 2024 through 21 June 2024","Mexico City","203465","0736587X","979-889176106-3","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207834392"

Originality/value: The management literature still seeks to understand the different social and economic impacts that the introduction of large language models (LLM) has produced. It is now recognized that such models are not neutral; they carry a large portion of the biases and discriminations found in human language. If used as support in writing job descriptions, it can contribute negatively to the preservation of gender inequality among occupations and the perpetuation of the sexual division of labor. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses different LLMs embeddings to evaluate potential gender biases generated in job postings from two major platforms, LinkedIn and Vagas.com. More specifically, it evaluates gender biases and identifies the vectors’ sensitivity within the context of gender inequality analysis. Findings: The degree of consistency between architectures varies significantly as the words contained in job descriptions and the two gender vectors are altered, which means that even pretrained models might not be reliable to understand gender bias. This lack of consistency indicates that the evaluation of gender bias might be different depending on the parameters. Also, a high sensitivity to pronouns was observed, and the difference between genders seems to be greater when we relate the unitary vectors “man” and “woman” with terms related to family. Contribution/implication: The use of LLM for job postings must be carried out with caution, and efforts to mitigate gender biases must take place on the corpus to be modeled before data training occurs. © 2024 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

One of the major issues for ED is the low-resource problem due to inadequate samples. Some studies address the low-resource issue with retrieving knowledge entries directly from knowledge bases while introducing a lot of irrelevant knowledge or failing the lookup. Moreover, recent work has attempted to employ large language models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) that directly access event types in unstructured text under low-resource scenarios. Although LLM-based approaches have obtained promising results, we consider that the full potential of LLMs has not been activated due to insufficient prompt information. Our research proposes a two-stage event detection method that collaborates small language models (SLMs) and LLMs, namely LSLAED. Specifically, we first fine-tune the SLM to generate three types of latent answers: answer-aware examples, structure-aware examples, and corresponding answer candidates. Subsequently, all latent answers will form the prompt and enable the LLM to improve performance through in-context learning. We evaluate the proposed method using precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Experiments on the ACE2005 and ERE-EN datasets have demonstrated that LSLAED achieves significant improvement in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Event detection; Large language model; Latent answers; Small language model","Event Types; Events detection; Irrelevant knowledge; Language model; Large language model; Latent answer; Lookups; Small language model; Unstructured texts","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208275276"

Specifically, the optimal design solution reduces the energy use intensity by 31.6 kWh/m2, improves the useful daylight index by 39%, and modulated the thermal comfort index, resulting in a decrement of 0.69 °C for the summer season and an enhancement of 0.64 °C for the winter season, respectively.

It offers improved post-cracking performance, increased fracture resistance, and efficient stress transfer by incorporating steel fibers into the concrete mix. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used to accurately estimate concrete qualities, thus reducing time and costs. This research focuses on a novel hybrid machine learning model that such as Gaussian process regression with genetic algorithm (GPR-GA), Random Forest with genetic algorithm (RF-GA), and extreme gradient boosting with genetic algorithm (XGB-GA) to predict the compressive strength of SFRC. The proposed hybrid ML models demonstrate superior performance with an R2 value over 0.92 at both the training and testing stages. Specifically, the R2 value was found to be 0.9804 for GPR-GA, 0.9204 for RF-GA, and 0.9706 for XGB-GA. The RMSE values for GPR-GA, RF-GA, and XGB-GA were 8.38, 16.88, and 16.88, respectively. The overall GPR-GA model outperformed compare to the other two hybrid machine learning models, XGB-GA and RF-GA. Additionally, the SHAP method was utilized to assess the influence of input variables on the predicted compressive strength (CS) of SRFC. From the SHAP analysis, it was found that the temperature and diameter input parameters had the highest influence on the predicted CS compared to other input features. The proposed hybrid ML models provide builders and designers with a flexible and effective tool for analyzing characteristics and making accurate forecasts of the compressive strength of SFRC under high temperatures in building applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Compressive strength; Machine learning; SHAP analysis; Steel fiber reinforced concrete","Adaptive boosting; Adversarial machine learning; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Fiber reinforced plastics; Gaussian distribution; Random forests; Regression analysis; Reinforcement learning; Gaussian process regression; Hybrid machine learning; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Random forests; SHAP analyze; Shapley; Steel fiber reinforced concretes; Fiber reinforced concrete","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","25208160","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209227829"

The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model.

It is becoming an urgent problem to evaluate the safety condition of bridge structures combining inspection data with artificial intelligence methods. This paper proposes a data-driven capacity assessment framework for existing RC bridges. The load capacity limit state (LCLS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) prediction model are established based on the proposed information fusion machine learning model. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimized support vector machine (SVM) learner is established to capture the relationship between the feature variables and the LSLS or SLS. Forty-five samples are obtained by static and dynamic simulation of the ANSYS models. Five-dimensional parameters are adopted as the key input parameters of the model, including the maximum dynamic deflection, crack opening ratio, and crack normal damage ratio at midspan, 1/4 span, and 3/4 span. The Shapley additive explanations method is proposed to conduct parameters sensitivity analysis. The results show that the GA-SVM regression algorithm in LCLS and SLS reduction factor prediction is better than the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The crack opening ratio is the most critical parameter that can considerably affect the outcomes of the LCLS and SLS prediction. © Korean Society of Civil Engineers 2024.","Bridge engineering; Finite element model; Genetic algorithm; Load bearing capacity; Support vector machine","Finite element method; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Reinforced concrete; Sensitivity analysis; Support vector machines; Bridge engineering; Existing reinforced concrete; Finite element modelling (FEM); Limit state; Load capacity limits; Load-bearing capacity; Reinforced concrete bridge; Serviceability limit state; State prediction; Support vectors machine; Genetic algorithms","Korean Society of Civil Engineers","","","","","","12267988","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200869621"

Surrogate-assisted selection plays a pivotal role in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), especially in addressing expensive optimization problems by reducing the number of real function evaluations. However, whether LLMs can serve as surrogate models remains an unknown. In this study, we propose a novel surrogate model based purely on LLM inference capabilities, eliminating the need for training. Specifically, we formulate model-assisted selection as a classification problem or a regression problem, utilizing LLMs to directly evaluate the quality of new solutions based on historical data. This involves predicting whether a solution is good or bad, or approximating its value. This approach is then integrated into EAs, termed LLM-assisted EA (LAEA). Detailed experiments compared the visualization results of 2D data from 9 mainstream LLMs, as well as their performance on 5-10 dimensional problems. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have significant potential as surrogate models in evolutionary computation, achieving performance comparable to traditional surrogate models only using inference. This work offers new insights into the application of LLMs in evolutionary computation.

The objectives of this study are to identify factors associated with early de-escalation and to analyse the impact of de-escalation on mortality in patients with Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (BSI) with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2. Methods: A prospective, multicentre cohort study was performed including episodes of BSI due to Enterobacterales and a SOFA score ≥ 2 who were receiving an active antipseudomonal β-lactam; the isolate should be susceptible to at least 1 narrower-spectrum antibiotic. Variables associated with de-escalation were identified using logistic binary regression. The association of de-escalation with 30-day mortality was investigated. Confounding was controlled by calculating a propensity score used as covariate, as matching variable, and for inverse probability treatment weighting. Results: Of the 582 patients included, de-escalation was performed in 311 (53.4%). Neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.18–0.75), central venous catheter (aOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.32–0.83), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing isolate (aOR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.17–0.48) were negatively associated with de-escalation, and urinary tract source was positively associated (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.56–3.33). The 30-day mortality was 6.8% (21 patients) in de-escalated patients and 14.4% (39) in not de-escalated patients (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI = 0.44–0.89). In multivariate analysis including the propensity score, de-escalation was not associated with mortality (AOR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.39–2.47) and was protective in the case of urinary or biliary tract source (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.09–1.06). Matched and inverse probability treatment weighting analysis showed similar results. Conclusions: These results suggest that early de-escalation from antipseudomonal β-lactams is safe in patients with Enterobacterales bacteremia and SOFA ≥ 2. © 2024","Bacteremia; Enterobacterales; Severe infection; SOFA score","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; beta lactam antibiotic; cefepime; ceftazidime; cephalosporin derivative; cotrimoxazole; ertapenem; imipenem; meropenem; piperacillin plus tazobactam; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antiinfective agent; adult; age; aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; biliary tract infection; bloodstream infection; catheter-related bacteremia; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; Enterobacterales; Escherichia coli; female; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; Klebsiella pneumoniae; major clinical study; male; mortality; neutropenia; post hoc analysis; predictive value; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; septic shock; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survival; treatment duration; urinary tract infection; bacteremia; clinical trial; drug effect; drug therapy; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; microbiology; middle aged; multicenter study; very elderly","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09248579","","IAAGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205022213"

Utilizing the model's extensive context capacity for iterative prompting without feedback, we sought to autonomously generate superior algorithmic versions. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the improvements did not progress linearly. Nevertheless, one iteration stood out significantly, consistently outperforming the baseline across various pairwise comparisons and showing a robust performance profile. This iteration's structure deviated substantially from traditional SOMA principles, underscoring the potential of large language models to create distinctive and effective algorithmic strategies. The results affirm the methodology's ability to produce high-performing algorithms without expert intervention, setting the stage for future research to integrate feedback mechanisms and conduct detailed code analyses to understand further the modifications made by the Large Language Models.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Yet, their predominantly English-centric training has led to biases and performance disparities across languages. This imbalance marginalizes minoritized languages, making equitable access to NLP technologies more difficult for languages with lower resources, such as Galician. We present the first two generative LLMs focused on Galician to bridge this gap. These models, freely available as open-source resources, were trained using a GPT architecture with 1.3B parameters on a corpus of 2.1B words. Leveraging continual pretraining, we adapt to Galician two existing LLMs trained on larger corpora, thus mitigating the data constraints that would arise if the training were performed from scratch. The models were evaluated using human judgments and task-based datasets from standardized benchmarks. These evaluations reveal a promising performance, underscoring the importance of linguistic diversity in generative models. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.","continual pertaining; Galician; large language models; open access","","Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural","","","","","","11355948","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206538925"

We focused on the differences in physical, rather than chemical, properties between EC- and PC-based solvents to explain the differences in the interphase formation properties on the graphitic anode. By probing solid–liquid interfaces before solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, we attributed the difference to the hindered kinetics of solvated Li+ co-intercalation into graphite at the early stage of SEI formation on the EC-graphite interface. This hindrance is due to enrichment of the interfacial region with EC molecules, which increases the local liquidus temperature of the electrolyte (Tm = 36.4 °C for EC and −48.8 °C for PC), as evidenced by the increased interfacial stiffness. The absence of such kinetic limitations for solvated Li+ ion intercalation in the PC electrolyte leads to a higher degree of co-intercalation of solvated molecules into graphite, resulting in severe graphite expansion upon reduction, followed by the SEI cracking along the edge plane. The following continuous co-intercalation of solvated Li+ closes the “co-intercalation-expansion-cracking” loop. This explains why a pure PC electrolyte cannot form a stable SEI on graphite. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024.","","Carbonates; Carbonation; Intercalation; Selenium compounds; Co-intercalation; Ethylene carbonate; Graphitic anode; Interface stiffness; Ion batteries; Li +; Property; Propylene carbonate; Propylene carbonate electrolyte; Solid electrolyte interphase; Solid electrolytes","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20507488","","JMCAE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206513989"

However, generating effective test cases for training and evaluating GP programs requires strong domain knowledge. Furthermore, GP programs often prematurely converge on local optima when given excessively difficult problems early in their training. Curriculum learning (CL) has been effective in addressing similar issues across different reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but it requires the manual generation of progressively difficult test cases as well as their careful scheduling. In this work, we leverage the domain knowledge and the strong generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate effective test cases of increasing difficulties and schedule them according to various curricula. We show that by integrating a curriculum scheduler with LLM-generated test cases we can effectively train a GP agent player with environments-based curricula for a single-player game and opponent-based curricula for a multi-player game. Finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing this method for other problem domains. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, due to its focus on collectivities, securitization theory cannot tell us why leaders choose either securitization or desecuritization. Understanding this choice is crucial because (de)securitization processes can prescribe possible foreign policy options and thus affect the likelihood of conflict and cooperation. To account for leaders’ choices, I draw on political psychology and demonstrate the utility of my approach through an explanation of two US presidents’ preferences for (de)securitizing North Korea. Using leadership trait and operational code analysis, I show that psychological variables shaped Bill Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s preferences because they affected their threat perception and inclination toward conflictual or cooperative actions. These preferences had substantial consequences: While Clinton’s desecuritization attempt led to improvements in US–North Korean relations, Bush’s effort to resecuritize North Korea effectively reversed this progress. © The Author(s) (2024).","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","17438586","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193613194"

Therefore, this research presents an integrated deep learning-based framework for soil moisture prediction, where long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, an attention mechanism, and fully connected layers are combined. In this framework, LSTM layers are applied to extract the complicated, long- and short-term dependencies from the time series soil moisture data. Besides, the attention mechanism is employed to learn the discriminative information from the extracted features. The genetic algorithm (GA), which aims to enhance the prediction accuracy, is applied to simultaneously determine the hyperparameters of the proposed network, called the GA-LSTM-ATT, consisting of the LSTM layer count, the hidden units in layers, the rate of dropout, and the learning rate. The experimental consequences have indicated that the GA-LSTM-ATT method outperforms the benchmark approaches in different evaluation indices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Genetic algorithm; Soil moisture prediction","Crops; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Soil moisture; Water resources; Agricultural activities; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Learning methods; Memory layers; Moisture data; Soil moisture predictions; Term dependency; Times series; Waters resources; Genetic algorithms","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09410643","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176551046"

Predicting WHF in a phase that is currently undiagnosable by physicians would enable prompt treatment of such events in patients at a higher risk of WHF. Although the role of Artificial Intelligence in cardiovascular diseases is becoming part of clinical practice, especially for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, its usage is often considered not completely reliable due to the incapacity of these models to provide a valid explanation about their output results. Physicians are often reluctant to make decisions based on unjustified results and see these models as black boxes. This study aims to develop a novel diagnostic model capable of predicting WHF while also providing an easy interpretation of the outcomes. We propose a threshold-based binary classifier built on a mathematical model derived from the Genetic Programming approach. This model clearly indicates that WHF is closely linked to creatinine, sPAP, and CAD, even though the relationship of these variables and WHF is almost complex. However, the proposed mathematical model allows for providing a 3D graphical representation, which medical staff can use to better understand the clinical situation of patients. Experiments conducted using retrospectively collected data from 519 patients treated at the HF Clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model, surpassing the most commonly used machine learning algorithms.

However, with the increase in the dimensions of process parameters and the number of samples, the relationship between process parameters and molten pool often exhibits high levels of uncertainty and nonlinearity. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used for complex LW systems modeling, but they may be limited and unable to fully capture the complex relationships when faced with complex systems. Additionally, traditional ML techniques may lack interpretability within the model, making it difficult to understand the input features and their impact on the output. To address these issues, a method that combines an interpretable multi-task neural network (MTNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Firstly, an LW experimental platform is constructed, and the orthogonal design is conducted for data collection. In the data preparation stage, the curriculum learning strategy is employed to reorganize the raw experimental data. Subsequently, the MTNN is constructed to automatically learn feature representations among input process parameters, capture nonlinear relationships between data, and share weights across multiple related tasks to improve efficiency and performance. Furthermore, the PSO is designed to determine the constraints and objective functions. In addition, the shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is utilized to calculate the importance of process parameters and enhance the interpretability. Finally, the optimization results are validated, and the results demonstrate that the optimized results of the proposed method have achieved satisfactory performance compared to the traditional ML methods. © 2024","Laser welding (LW); Multi-task neural network (MTNN); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Process parameters optimization (PPO); Shapley additive explanation (SHAP)","Additives; Complex networks; Learning systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Laser welding; Multi tasks; Multi-task neural network; Neural-networks; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Process parameter optimization; Process parameters optimizations; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Swarm optimization; Laser beam welding","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196796266"

However, the underlying mechanisms of B. pumilus strains remain unclear as to how they are beneficial for plants as stress tolerant and growth promoters. Bacillus pumilus was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Artemisia vulgaris. NGS (next-generation sequencing) was performed for the strain to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbial interactions. NGS revealed 3,910 genes, 3294 genes with protein-coding, and 11 functional genomic regions related to diverse agronomic traits including stress tolerance. We identified the two possible phytohormone biosynthesis approaches from metabolic regions1(terpense→diterpense→betacarotene→xanthoxin→ABA)2(terpense→diterpense→geranyl diphosphate →C20 →GA). Several gene clusters related to the biosynthesis of phytohormones, stress tolerance, and agricultural diversification were predicted. The genome provides insights into the possible mechanisms of this bacterium for stress tolerance and its future applications. The genomic organization of B. pumilus revealed several hallmarks of its plant growth promotion and pathogen suppression activities.

The existing methods of automated program repair leave a lot of room for improvement. Fault localization, which aims to find lines of code that are potentially buggy, minimises the search space of an automated program repair system. Recent work has shown improvement in these fault localization methods, with the use of Large Language Models. Here, we propose a system where a LLM-based fault localization tool, which we call SemiAutoFL, is used within a fully automatic program repair program, ARJA-e. We show that utilising LLM-based fault localization with ARJA-e can significantly improve its performance on real world bugs. ARJA-e with SemiAutoFL can repair 10 bugs that ARJA-e was previously unable to so do. This finding adds to our understanding of how to improve fault localization and automated program repair, highlighting the potential for more efficient and accurate fault localisation methods being applied to automated program repair. © 2024 is held by the owner/author(s).","fault localisation; genetic improvement; large language models","Automatic programming; Computer debugging; Automatic programs; Fault localization; Genetic improvements; Language model; Large language model; Line of codes; Localization method; Repair program; Repair system; Search spaces; Program debugging","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (ACM SIGEVO)","2024 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion, GECCO 2024 Companion","14 July 2024 through 18 July 2024","Melbourne","201625","","979-840070495-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201966223"

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson's ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio.

However, PV power generation is entirely dependent on the amount of downward solar radiation reaching the solar cells. This is determined by uncertain and uncontrollable meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, as well as other factors such as topographical characteristics. Good solar radiation prediction models can increase energy output while decreasing the operation costs of PV power generation. For example, in some provinces in China, PV stations are required to upload short-term online power forecast information to power dispatching agencies. Numerous AI, statistical, and numerical weather prediction models have been used in many real-world renewable energy applications, with a focus on modeling accuracy. However, there is a need for explainable AI models that could be easily understood, analyzed, and augmented by the stakeholders. In this article, we present a compact, explainable, and lifelong learning metaheuristic-based interval type-2 fuzzy logic system for solar radiation modeling. The generated model will be composed of a small number of short IF-Then rules that have been optimized via simulated annealing to produce models with high prediction accuracy. These models are updated through a life-long learning approach to maximize their accuracy and maintain interpretability. In the process of lifelong learning, the proposed method transferred the model's knowledge to new geographical locations with minimal forgetting. The proposed method achieved good prediction accuracy and outperformed on new geographical locations other transparent and black-box models by 13.2% as well as maintaining excellent generalization ability. The resulting models have been evaluated and accepted by experts, and thanks to the generated transparency, the experts were able to augment the models with their expertise, which increased the models' accuracy.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Explainable AI (XAI); solar energy; type-2 fuzzy systems","Electric load dispatching; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Numerical models; Simulated annealing; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Weather forecasting; Wind; Geographical locations; Life long learning; Metaheuristic; Modeling accuracy; Photovoltaic power generation; Prediction accuracy; Predictive models; Solar radiation model; Type-2 fuzzy systems; XAI; Solar energy","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","10636706","","IEFSE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182353761"

One of the main approaches is genetic algorithms (GAs). However, due to their complexity, users may need help understanding or communicating GA applications, preventing their widespread acceptance among factory workers. The concept of explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to address this issue. This study reviews existing XAI techniques for explaining GA applications in job scheduling and summarizes the problems existing XAI techniques face. Several novel XAI techniques are proposed to solve these problems, including decision tree-based interpretation, dynamic transformation and contribution diagrams, and improved bar charts. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, it is applied to a case from the literature. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology can compensate for the deficiencies of existing XAI methods in handling high-dimensional data and visualizing the contribution of feasible solutions, thereby satisfying all the requirements for an effective XAI technique for explaining GA applications in job scheduling. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to explain other evolutionary AI applications in job scheduling, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Job scheduling","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling algorithms; Artificial intelligence technologies; Bar chart; Dynamic transformation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Feasible solution; Genetic algorithm application; High dimensional data; Jobs scheduling; Tree-based; Workers'; Genetic algorithms","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170650009"

This enables EXA-GP to utilize the full suite of optimizations provided by EXAMM, such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, island based populations with re-population events, as well as Lamarckian weight inheritance and backpropagation for optimization of constant values. Results show that EXA-GP's evolved genetic programs achieve the same levels of accuracy as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) evolved by EXAMM, while at the same time being more explainable. EXA-GP's genetic programs are also computationally less complex than EXAMM's RNNs, suggesting that GP operations may actually be more effective than gated recurrent memory cells for time series forecasting.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the outcomes of the de-escalation strategy compared with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor in stabilized patients with AMI and high ischemic risk following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a post hoc analysis of the Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel in Stabilized Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (TALOS-AMI) trial, an open-label, assessor-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Patients with AMI who had no event during 1 month of ticagrelor-based DAPT after PCI were included. High ischemic risk was defined as having a history of diabetes or chronic kidney disease, multivessel PCI, at least 3 lesions treated, total stent length greater than 60 mm, at least 3 stents implanted, left main PCI, or bifurcation PCI with at least 2 stents. Data were collected from February 14, 2014, to January 21, 2021, and analyzed from December 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to either de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel or ticagrelor-based DAPT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemic outcomes (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis) and bleeding outcomes (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding) were evaluated. RESULTS Of 2697 patients with AMI (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [11.4] years; 454 [16.8%] female), 1371 (50.8%; 684 assigned to de-escalation and 687 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) had high ischemic risk features and a significantly higher risk of ischemic outcomes than those without high ischemic risk (1326 patients [49.2%], including 665 assigned to de-escalation and 661 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.15-2.63; P =.01). De-escalation to clopidogrel, compared with ticagrelor-based DAPT, showed no significant difference in ischemic risk across the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54-1.45; P =.62) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28; P =.21), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.47). The bleeding risk of the de-escalation group was consistent in both the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.11; P =.11) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.75; P =.003), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In stabilized patients with AMI, the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of an unguided de-escalation strategy with clopidogrel compared with a ticagrelor-based DAPT strategy were consistent without significant interaction, regardless of the presence of high ischemic risk. © 2023 American Medical Association.

Traditional diagnostic methods, based on visual examination, are subjective, time-intensive, and require specialized expertise. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for skin cancer detection face challenges such as computational inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and reliance on standalone CNN architectures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a comprehensive pipeline combining transfer learning, feature selection, and machine-learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy. Multiple pretrained CNN models were evaluated, with Xception emerging as the optimal choice for its balance of computational efficiency and performance. An ablation study further validated the effectiveness of freezing task-specific layers within the Xception architecture. Feature dimensionality was optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization, reducing dimensions from 1024 to 508, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Machine-learning classifiers, including Subspace KNN and Medium Gaussian SVM, further improved classification accuracy. Evaluated on the ISIC 2018 and HAM10000 datasets, the proposed pipeline achieved impressive accuracies of 98.5% and 86.1%, respectively. Moreover, Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM, LIME, and Occlusion Sensitivity, enhanced interpretability. This approach provides a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution for automated skin cancer diagnosis in clinical applications. © 2024 by the authors.","ablation; explainable-AI; feature extraction; feature selection; medium Gaussian SVM; particle swarm optimization; subspace KNN; transfer learning","Adversarial machine learning; Feature Selection; Gaussian distribution; Lung cancer; Transfer learning; Explainable-artificial intelligence; Features extraction; Features selection; Gaussians; Medium gaussian SVM; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Subspace KNN; Swarm optimization; Transfer learning; Ablation","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2313433X","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213436359"

In recent times, one of the deadliest respiratory diseases, COVID-19, which causes serious damage to the lungs has claimed a lot of lives globally. Machine learning-based systems can assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of the disease, which can reduce the deadly effects of the disease. For the successful deployment of these machine learning-based systems, hyperparameter-based optimization and feature selection are important issues. Motivated by the above, in this proposal, we design an improved model to predict the existence of respiratory disease among patients by incorporating hyperparameter optimization and feature selection. To optimize the parameters of the machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter optimization with a genetic algorithm is proposed and to reduce the size of the feature set, feature selection is performed using binary grey wolf optimization algorithm. Moreover, to enhance the efficacy of the predictions made by hyperparameter-optimized machine learning models, an ensemble model is proposed using a stacking classifier. Also, explainable AI was incorporated to define the feature importance by making use of Shapely adaptive explanations (SHAP) values. For the experimentation, the publicly accessible Mexico clinical dataset of COVID-19 was used. The results obtained show that the proposed model has superior prediction accuracy in comparison to its counterparts. Moreover, among all the hyperparameter-optimized algorithms, adaboost algorithm outperformed all the other hyperparameter-optimized algorithms. The various performance assessment metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, were used to assess the results. © 2024 Kaur et al.

In this study, the major factors causing the rapid loss of water storage during 2003–2020 are first investigated using correlation analysis, where the storage estimates are derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. The major hydroclimatic drivers of monthly water storage changes are then explored among precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (RO) using an interpretable deep learning (IDL) method. The relative contribution of each driver is quantified by leveraging the interpretability nature of IDL. Results show that the GWS depletion (–0.82 cm/year) primarily accounts for the TWS loss (–0.73 cm/year) in the Ordos Basin under increased precipitation. The decreased TWS and GWS are both closely related to the increased vegetation density and coal production, indicating that they are the major drivers of the long-term water loss. At the monthly scale, the IDL method reveals that P and ET contribute over 75% to the changes of both TWS and GWS in most regions. The response lag of TWS to P and ET is generally 1–3 months. In contrast, GWS shows a more complicated response to P and ET with a longer lag range of 1–11 months in different regions due to the complicated Ordos Basin aquifer systems. These findings achieve a better understanding of hydrologic cycles and better guide sustainable water resources management in the Ordos Basin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Association of Hydrogeologists.","Arid regions; China; GRACE; Groundwater storage; Interpretable deep learning","China; Ordos Basin; arid region; GRACE; groundwater; machine learning; satellite data; water storage","Institute for Ionics","","","","","","14312174","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171846650"

Predicting compressive strength (CS), a key mechanical property, is essential for optimal performance. Due to the nonlinear nature of FASC mixtures, researchers now utilize machine learning tools. This study evaluates three machine learning models by combining traditional AI algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), with nature-inspired optimization techniques, such as chicken swarm optimization (CSO), moth flame optimization algorithm (MOFA), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA). By addressing the gaps in mechanical property variation, dataset scope, and model comparison, this study demonstrated high accuracy in CS prediction for all three models. The ANN optimized by WOA consistently excelled across multiple metrics.

Here, we reported the long-term outcomes and post-hoc exploratory analyses. Methods: This single-arm, phase II trial enrolled 42 patients diagnosed with unresectable stage I–IVA ESCC was conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between November 2019 and January 2021. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy (weekly 50 mg/m2 of paclitaxel and 25 mg/m2 of cisplatin for five cycles), concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), and toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year). The primary endpoint was clinical complete response (CR) rate at 3 months after CRT completion. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were evaluated. Additionally, the exploratory objectives included analysing recurrence patterns, assessing the associations between immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and efficacy, and identifying potential predictors for irAEs. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04005170). Findings: With a median follow-up of 44.3 months (IQR 40.8–46.1), the 3-year OS and PFS rates were 44.8% (95% CI 31.9–62.8) and 35.7% (95% CI 23.8–53.6), respectively. Patients who failed to achieve a clinical complete response (CR) demonstrated significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 13.73, 95% CI 4.43–42.54, P < 0.0001) and PFS (HR = 32.08, 95% CI 8.57–120.10, P < 0.0001). Disease recurrence occurred in 23 of 42 patients (55%), with recurrences being earlier and more frequent in the non-CR group compared to the CR group. Patients experiencing irAEs showed a significantly higher CR rate (72% vs. 39%, P = 0.082) and better PFS (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19–0.93, P = 0.027) than those without irAEs. GON4L mutation was associated with a lower incidence of irAEs (P = 0.036). Interpretation: The updated survival outcomes confirmed the efficacy of toripalimab plus definitive CRT in locally advanced ESCC. Moreover, the development of irAEs may predict a more favourable prognosis.

This paper proposes an image dehazing network based on multi-scale lifting and attention mechanism fusion U-Net structure. Firstly, the downsampling operation is used to obtain multi-scale feature maps, and the feature maps of the encoder and decoder are connected by jump connection to realize feature fusion. The purpose is to transfer and fuse information between feature maps of different scales to improve the performance of the model. At the same time, in order to better aggregate cross-window information, an overlapping cross-attention module is introduced to enhance the information complementarity of adjacent window functions. By comparing the proposed algorithm with the other five algorithms in the public datasets Reside and NTIRE, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in defogging effect and color retention. Specifically, the average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the proposed algorithm reaches 27.5 dB, and the average structure similarity (SSIM) is 0.9573. Compared with the other five algorithms, the performance has been significantly improved. Compared with the best comparison algorithm, the PSNR of the proposed algorithm is improved by 2.17 dB, and the SSIM is improved by 0.0063. These experimental results fully prove that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance in dehazing performance and color retention.  © 2024 SPIE.","attention mechanism; cross-focus module; image de-fogging; jump connection; multi-scale enhancement","Color; Demulsification; Signal to noise ratio; Attention mechanisms; Color retention; Cross-focus module; Dehazing; Feature map; Image de-fogging; Jump connections; Multi-scale enhancement; Multi-scales; Performance; Image enhancement","SPIE","Academic Exchange Information Centre (AEIC); Hohai University","2023 International Conference on Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Processing, ICCAID 2023","1 December 2023 through 3 December 2023","Qingdao","198902","0277786X","978-151067768-5","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191507662"

The primary objective of this combination is to enhance the discriminatory capabilities of specific criteria, thereby elevating the precision of the machine learning model. Specifically, the crafting of the classification was executed through Fisher-KNN (F-KNN), linear support vector machine (L-SVM), and the Fisher visual decision tree (F-Tree).Genetic algorithms were employed for targeted selection to amplify the efficiency of these models in accurately identifying COVID-19 samples within CT images. The outcomes of this investigation offer valuable insights for continuous endeavors aimed at enhancing COVID-19 diagnostics by integrating architecture, genetic algorithms, and machine learning models. Notably, among the proposed methodologies, the fuzzy tree classifier achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.55%, while alternative classifiers such as Naive Bayes, L-SVM, and F-KNN attained accuracies of 92.6%, 92.12%, and 92.33% respectively.

Examining the logic of the models ensures both their safe deployment and allows for effective interventions and corrections in behaviour to help children avoid experiencing cyberbullying. Our models show that increased awareness from parents about the apps their children use, as well as their social media activity are important to avoid cyberbullying.

To overcome data scarcity and enhance NER performance, we propose a data augmentation approach. This approach leverages a large language model to generate synthetic speech style text data enriched with diverse PII entities. The generated data undergoes an iterative process using a customized NER model for semi-automatic PII annotation.

Based on mixed integer programming, existing methods rely on branch-and-bound aided algorithms and can struggle to achieve satisfactory computational time performance. In order to avoid the computational burden of branch-and-bound, this work introduces the Column-Generation-based Genetic Algorithm (CGbGA) as a heuristic approach to the ONTS problem. The method, based on branch-and-price principles, combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem of interest efficiently. We generate solution vectors for each job using DP and adapt mutation and crossover operators to work on a column-wide scale. This ensures that every solution is valid for the given job. Also, a novel pseudo-shadow pricing strategy is employed to mimic the pricing procedure of the branch-and-price algorithm. To better understand the impact of the number of available columns on the incumbent solution, we employ Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Our results, based on a set of representative literature instances, demonstrate the potential of CGbGA in terms of solution value and computational solving time compared to commercially available solvers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic Algorithm; Nanosatellite; Quality of Service; Scheduling","Costs; Dynamic programming; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Lime; Multiobjective optimization; Multitasking; Orbits; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Branch and bounds; Column generation; Energy aware; Knapsacks; Nanosatellite; Offline; Quality-of-service; Scheduling; Task scheduling problem; Tasks scheduling; Genetic algorithms","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162182764"

Utilising a theoretical economic model, the study delves into the persistence of these extractive practices and their eventual transformation into more inclusive, market-driven systems. By charting Diamang’s historical trajectory, the paper explores how this deeply entrenched system transitioned from coercive labour to a free-market system, catalysed by significant socio-political changes such as the abrupt independence of neighbouring countries, domestic unrest and international pressures. The model provides new insights into the historical dominance of coercive labour institutions and reveals how external shocks can precipitate rapid institutional change. Ultimately, this study enhances our understanding of colonial labour market dynamics and highlights the evolving nature of extractive practices within economic history, with specific reference to the understudied case of the Portuguese colonial empire. © 2024, Department of Economic History and Institutions, Policy and World Economy.

The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.. ©2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Electronic health record; Computer-based system; Data governances; De-identification; Digitisation; Discharge summary; Financial impacts; Healthcare organizations; Language model; Patient discharge; Personal information","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","ACL Special Interest Group on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (SIGBIOMED)","23rd Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Biomedical Natural Language Processing, BioNLP 2024","16 August 2024","Bangkok","202280","","979-889176130-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204503249"

By comparing three regions, Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, the article shows that de facto regional policy autonomy varies, although the regions are constitutionally symmetrical. Why do some regions have less de facto autonomy than others? Contrary to conventional expectations, party noncongruence appears less important in explaining the regional autonomy variation. Regional capacity, national integration goals and development objectives appear to have played a major role in generating de facto regional policy autonomy variation without a constitutional amendment. Regions lacking capacity and peripheral regions tend to face more centralization than others. Insights from Ethiopia imply that states embracing federalism should consider regional inequality in development and capacity in designing a federal constitution.  © 2022 The Author(s).","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","00485950","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159661256"

Design: Deep learning model development. Participants: Three hundred eleven participants from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SD-OCT Study. Methods: A dataset of 1284 SD-OCT scans from 311 participants was used to develop Deep-GA-Net. Cross-validation was used to evaluate Deep-GA-Net, where each testing set contained no participant from the corresponding training set. En face heatmaps and important regions at the B-scan level were used to visualize the outputs of Deep-GA-Net, and 3 ophthalmologists graded the presence or absence of GA in them to assess the explainability (i.e., understandability and interpretability) of its detections. Main Outcome Measures: Accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under precision-recall curve (APR). Results: Compared with other networks, Deep-GA-Net achieved the best metrics, with accuracy of 0.93, AUC of 0.94, and APR of 0.91, and received the best gradings of 0.98 and 0.68 on the en face heatmap and B-scan grading tasks, respectively. Conclusions: Deep-GA-Net was able to detect GA accurately from SD-OCT scans. The visualizations of Deep-GA-Net were more explainable, as suggested by 3 ophthalmologists.

Explaining this psychological phenomenon could help to reduce side-effect experience, however, it is yet to be explored if this can be applied to clinical settings where new medication is prescribed. In addition, the degree to which a health-care provider empathetically communicates this to patients may have an impact. To investigate this, we carried out 2 × 2 factorial trial to assess the effect of nocebo explanation and empathy (plus their interaction) on side-effect expectations following a fictional GP consultation prescribing a new medication. Overall, 208 participants were randomised to watch one of the four fictive GP consultations and play the role of the patient. In all videos, participants received information about the reason for the consultation, the recommendation of a new fictive medicine, how to take it, benefits and side-effects. The videos differed in whether the GP provided an explanation of the nocebo effect (yes/no) and whether they communicated in an empathetic style (yes/no). After watching the video, participants were asked about their side-effect expectations and rated the quality of the GP’s communication. Two-way ANOVAs revealed no main effect of nocebo explanation on expectation of side-effects warned or not warned about in the consultation. However, there was a main effect of empathy, with participants watching the empathetic consultations having significantly lower expectations of non-warned-about side-effects. There was no significant interaction. Findings suggest that explaining the nocebo effect and GP empathy did little to allay expectations of side-effects that were specifically mentioned in the consultation. However, GP empathy had an effect by helping to reduce additional side-effect expectations participants still had. Future work should extend these findings to real GP consultations where the full dimensions of empathy can be explored. © 2023 The Author(s).

This manuscript aims to explore the potential applications and benefits of AI-assisted surgical training, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs), in enhancing communication, personalizing feedback, and promoting skill development. We discuss the advancements in simulation-based training, AI-driven assessment tools, video-based assessment systems, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, and the potential role of LLMs in the transcription, translation, and summarization of feedback. Despite the promising opportunities presented by AI integration, several challenges must be addressed, including accuracy and reliability, ethical and privacy concerns, bias in AI models, integration with existing training systems, and training and adoption of AI-assisted tools. By proactively addressing these challenges and harnessing the potential of AI, the future of surgical training may be reshaped to provide a more comprehensive, safe, and effective learning experience for trainees, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. © 2023, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes.

Leveraging eight pivotal input features—building compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution—we elucidate the intricate relationships between building characteristics and their corresponding heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL). We meticulously analyze these features across 12 diverse structural forms, each emblematic of unique architectural designs and building materials. Using a dataset encompassing 768 buildings, we demonstrate the prowess of our proposed models. Among the algorithms we employed, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm stands out, registering impressive accuracy metrics (HL: RSQ = 0.9986, RMSE = 0.3797, MAE = 0.2467 and MAPE = 1.1812; CL: RSQ = 0.9938, RMSE = 0.7578, MAE = 0.4546 and MAPE = 1.6365). We further integrate SHAP analysis, revealing that relative compactness positively influences both HL and CL the most, closely followed by surface area and glazing area. By merging an explainable extreme gradient boosting algorithm with a Bayesian-based metaheuristic optimization technique, we ensure both high predictive accuracy and interpretability. This study holds profound implications for enhancing building energy efficiency, curbing waste, and championing the shift to sustainable energy sources, aligning seamlessly with SDG 7. © 2023 The Authors","Building energy performance; Explainable ML; Heating and cooling loads; Metaheuristic Bayesian optimization; ML algorithms; SHAP analysis","Energy efficiency; Glazes; Optimization; Bayesian optimization; Building energy performance; Cooling load; Explainable ML; Heating and cooling loads; Heating load; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic bayesian optimization; ML algorithm; SHAP analyse; Buildings","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22145095","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177171405"

Lifestyle, genetics, nutrition, and stress are all significant contributors to rising mortality rates. CAD is preventable through early intervention and lifestyle changes. As a result, low-cost automated solutions are required to detect CAD early and help healthcare professionals treat chronic diseases efficiently. Machine learning applications in medicine have increased due to their ability to detect data patterns. Employing machine learning to classify the occurrence of coronary artery disease could assist doctors in reducing misinterpretation. The research project entails the creation of a coronary artery disease diagnosis system based on machine learning. Using patient medical records, we demonstrate how machine learning can help identify if an individual will acquire coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the study highlights the most critical risk factors for coronary artery disease. We used two machine learning approaches, Catboost and LightGBM classifiers, to predict the patient with coronary artery disease. We employed various data augmentation methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), to solve the imbalanced data problem. Optuna was applied to optimize hyperparameters. The proposed method was tested on the real-world dataset Z-Alizadeh Sani. The acquired findings were satisfactory, as the model could predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a particular individual by combining Catboost with VAE, which demonstrated good accuracy compared to the other approaches. The proposed model is evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, recall, f-score, precision, and ROC curve. Furthermore, we used the SHAP values and Boruta Feature Selection (BFS) to determine essential risk factors for coronary artery disease. © 2023; Los autores.","Coronary Artery Disease; Data Augmentation; Explainable Machine Learning; Risk Factors","","Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","","","","","","29534917","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182494891"

Genetic programming (GP) has been widely used to learn scheduling heuristics for DFJSS automatically. Ideally, we prefer to have effective and small scheduling heuristics which tend to be easy to be interpreted. However, the effectiveness and the sizes of scheduling heuristics are conflicting, and reducing the rule sizes tends to worsen the effectiveness of scheduling heuristics. This is a typical multi-objective optimisation problem. However, the existing studies in multi-objective DFJSS consider the effectiveness-related objectives only such as minimising max-flowtime and mean-flowtime rather than interpretability-related objectives such as rule size. To fill this gap, this paper aims to propose an interpretability-aware multi-objective GP to learn a well-distributed Pareto-front of scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. This paper first adopts a multi-objective GP algorithm with α-dominance and archive from a routing problem to DFJSS. Then, we propose to use traditional dominance relation based Pareto front for α and archive updating and an objective normalisation based α-dominance sorting strategy to further improve the performance of the adopted multi-objective GP. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-objective GP algorithms in different DFJSS scenarios. © 2023 IEEE.","Job shop scheduling; Multi-objective genetic programming; Scheduling heuristics learning; α-dominance","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Multiobjective optimization; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Heuristic learning; Interpretability; Job-Shop scheduling; Learn+; Multi objective; Multi-objective genetic programming; Scheduling heuristic learning; Scheduling heuristics; Α-dominance; Job shop scheduling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2023","1 July 2023 through 5 July 2023","Chicago","192935","","979-835031458-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174525423"

Nowadays there is no standardized method for urinary continence measurement. Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction (PRR) is a surgical step that can improve early urinary continence after RP. Our objective was to analyse different continence definitions and predictors of urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted RP (RARP). Materials and methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (NCT03302169) including 152 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer subjected to RARP. Patients were randomised to single urethrovesical anastomosis (control arm) or PRR before urethrovesical anastomosis (PRR arm). Urinary continence was measured with the EPIC-26 and ICIQ-SF validated questionnaires, and pad use (0-1 pads and no pads), at 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days after catheter removal. Prognostic factors for early urinary continence recovery were analysed. Results: 72 patients were included in the control arm and 80 in the PRR arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms, except body mass index, which was higher in PRR arm. “No pad” was the only definition assessing the benefit of PRR at 30 days, 33.8% in PRR arm and 18.1% in control arm, p = 0.022; and at 90 days, 58.8 and 43.1% respectively, p = 0.038. Questionnaires did not detect differences in terms of continence recovery. PRR was the only predictor for early continence recovery, p = 0.03. Conclusions: PRR increased early urinary continence recovery after RARP. Continence definition was critical to assess benefit. The only predictive factor for early continence recovery was PRR. © 2022 AEU","Early urinary continence recovery; Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction; Robot assisted radical prostatectomy","Humans; Male; Prognosis; Prostate; Prostatectomy; Quality of Life; Robotics; adverse event; controlled study; human; male; procedures; prognosis; prostate; prostatectomy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; robotics; surgery","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02104806","","AUESD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124221193"

Topographic complexity can render these conditions quite variable across the landscape and the effects on plant ecological responses are difficult to document. We used a set of topographically defined hydrological metrics to evaluate community composition and single-species responses of four plant groups [pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes), Melastomataceae, palms (Arecaceae) and Zingiberales] to topographic conditions in the middle Juruá River region, in western Brazilian Amazonia. The area spans two geological formations (Içá and Solimões) with contrasting topography. River terraces are also found along the main rivers in the area. Local topographic conditions were approximated by height above the nearest drainage (HAND), slope, and Strahler´s drainage order, all obtained from a SRTM digital elevation model (DEM). Data were analyzed using linear and generalized linear mixed models and regression trees. HAND was most successful in explaining floristic composition for all plant groups, except for Melastomataceae, and was more important in the hilly Içá formation than in the Solimões. Individual occurrences of 57% species were predicted by at least one of the topographic variables, suggesting a marked habitat specialization along topographic gradients. For these species, response models using SRTM-DEM-derived variables gave similar results than models using field-measured topography only. Our results suggest that topographical variables estimated from remote sensing can be used to predict local variation in the structure of plant communities in tropical forests. © 2022, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

The HIoT systems find use in several applications such as smart cities, healthcare, transportation, etc. Besides, the HIoT system and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools can be deployed in the healthcare sector for effective decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue that necessitates automated and effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at the initial stage. This article presents a new quantum-inspired differential evolution with explainable artificial intelligence based COVID-19 Detection and Classification (QIDEXAI-CDC) model for HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model aims to identify the occurrence of COVID-19 using the XAI tools on HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model primarily uses bilateral filtering (BF) as a preprocessing tool to eradicate the noise. In addition, RetinaNet is applied for the generation of useful feature vectors from radiological images. For COVID-19 detection and classification, quantum-inspired differential evolution (QIDE) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model is utilized. The utilization of the QIDE algorithm helps to appropriately choose the weight and bias values of the KELM model. In order to report the enhanced COVID-19 detection outcomes of the QIDEXAI-CDC model, a wide range of simulations was carried out.

However, while considerable progress has recently been made in the machine learning based prediction of reservoir permeability, the generalization of this approach is limited by weak interpretability. Hence, an interpretable XGBoost model is proposed herein based on particle swarm optimization to predict the permeability of tight sandstone reservoirs with higher accuracy and robust interpretability. The porosity and permeability of 202 core plugs and 6 logging curves (namely, the gamma-ray (GR) curve, the acoustic curve (AC), the spontaneous potential (SP) curve, the caliper (CAL) curve, the deep lateral resistivity (RILD) curve, and eight lateral resistivity (RFOC) curve) are extracted along with three derived variables (i.e., the shale content, the AC slope, and the GR slope) as data sets. Based on the data preprocessing, global and local interpretations are performed according to the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, and the redundant features in the data set are screened to identify the porosity, AC, CAL, and GR slope as the four most important features. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is then used to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model. The prediction results of the PSO-XGBoost model indicate a superior performance compared with that of the benchmark XGBoost model. In addition, the reliable application of the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model in the prediction of tight sandstone reservoir permeability is examined by comparing the results with those of two traditional mathematical regression models, five machine learning models, and three deep learning models. Thus, the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model is shown to have more advantages in permeability prediction along with the lowest root mean square error, thereby confirming the effectiveness and practicability of this method.  © 2022 Jing-Jing Liu and Jian-Chao Liu.","","algorithm; hydrocarbon reservoir; machine learning; optimization; permeability; porosity; sandstone","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","14688115","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123194072"

The proposed method aims to (1) accurately estimate formation energies with limited first-principles calculation data, (2) visually monitor the progress of the structure search process, (3) extract correlations between structures and formation energies, and (4) recommend the most beneficial candidates of SmFe12-substituted structures for the subsequent first-principles calculations. The structures of SmFe12 - α - βXαYβ before optimization are prepared by substituting X, Y elements—Mo, Zn, Co, Cu, Ti, Al, Ga—in the region of α + β < 4 into iron sites of the original SmFe12 structures. Using the optimized structures and formation energies obtained from the first-principles calculations after each active learning cycle, we construct an embedded two-dimensional space to rationally visualize the set of all the calculated and not-yet-calculated structures for monitoring the progress of the search. Our machine learning model with an embedding representation attained a prediction error for the formation energy of 1.25 × 10 - 2 (eV/atom) and required only one-sixth of the training data compared to other learning methods. Moreover, the time required to recall most potentially stable structures was nearly four times faster than the random search. The formation energy landscape visualized using the embedding representation revealed that the substitutions of Al and Ga have the highest potential to stabilize the SmFe12 structure. In particular, SmFe9[Al/Ga]2Ti showed the highest stability among the investigated structures. Finally, by quantitatively measuring the change in the structures before and after optimization using OFM descriptors, the correlations between the coordination number of substitution sites and the resulting formation energy are revealed. The negative-formation-energy-family SmFe12 - α - β[Al/Ga]αYβ structures show a common trend of increasing coordination number at substituted sites, whereas structures with positive formation energy show a corresponding decreasing trend. Impact statement: Seeking the next generation of high-performance magnets is a crucial demand for replacing the widely accepted Nd-Fe-B magnets developed in the middle 80s. The iron-rich compounds with the original tetragonal ThMn12 structure appear as the most potential candidates except for the hard synthesizing it in nature due to its high energy of formation. Stabilization for this material system is expected by substituting new elements, but the vast number of possible structures makes the exploration difficult even for theoretical calculations. This article proposes an integration of first-principles calculations and explainable active learning to efficiently explore the crystal structure space of this material system. In particular, the explored crystal structure space can be rationally visualized, on which the relationship between substitution elements, substitution sites, and crystal structure stabilization can be intuitively interpreted. © 2022, The Author(s).","Active learning; Materials discovery; Rare earths magnets; SmFe<sub>12</sub>","Abstracting; Aluminum alloys; Artificial intelligence; Calculations; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal structure; Data visualization; Embeddings; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Rare earths; Samarium alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Active Learning; Crystals structures; Embeddings; First principle calculations; Formation energies; Material discovery; Optimisations; Potentially stable; Rare earth magnet; [Co/Cu]; Binary alloys","Springer Nature","","","","","","08837694","","MRSBE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137229396"

Why then do some states seek a de-judicialization yet others increased judicialization of dispute settlement mechanisms in their pursuit of regulatory space? This article advances a twofold argument. First, the concept of judicialization has been erroneously conflated with state perceptions of regulatory space under dispute settlement mechanisms. States aspiring to consolidate regulatory space may pursue de-judicialization and increased judicialization alike. Second, states' preferences for de-judicialization or increased judicialization to regain regulatory space should largely depend on conceptions of legitimate international law as either intergovernmental contracts or cosmopolitan quasi-constitutional order. The article illustrates these arguments at the example of US and EU efforts to reform the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization and investor-to-state dispute settlement. Both seek to increase regulatory space. Yet, the USA pursues de-judicialization while the EU promotes judicialization. © 2021 The Author.

LSTM has been applied for forecasting time series, which is generated when variables are observed at discrete and equal time intervals. Nevertheless, the problem of determining hyperparameters with a relatively high random rate will reduce the accuracy of the prediction results. This paper aims to promote LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism. PSO optimizes LSTM hyperparameters, and Bifold-attention mechanism selects the optimal input for LSTM. An accurate, adaptive, and robust time-series forecasting model is the main contribution, compared with ARIMA, MLP, LSTM, PSO-LSTM, A-LSTM, and PSO-A-LSTM. The model comparison is based on the accuracy of each model in forecasting Beijing PM2.5, Beijing Multi-Site, Air Quality, Appliances Energy, Wind Speed, and Traffic Flow. The Proposed model, LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism, has lower MAPE and RMSE than baselines. In other words, the model outperformed all LSTM base models in this study.

It is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus. This virus is highly infectious and relies on its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor to enter cells. With the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, the difficulty of diagnosis due to the lack of global healthcare resources becomes increasingly apparent. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis models with high generalisability can effectively alleviate this pressure. Hyperparameter tuning is essential in training such models and significantly impacts their final performance and training speed. However, traditional hyperparameter tuning methods are usually time-consuming and unstable. To solve this issue, we introduce Particle Swarm Optimisation to build a PSO-guided Self-Tuning Convolution Neural Network (PSTCNN), allowing the model to tune hyperparameters automatically. Therefore, the proposed approach can reduce human involvement. Also, the optimisation algorithm can select the combination of hyperparameters in a targeted manner, thus stably achieving a solution closer to the global optimum. Experimentally, the PSTCNN can obtain quite excellent results, with a sensitivity of 93.65% ± 1.86%, a specificity of 94.32% ± 2.07%, a precision of 94.30% ± 2.04%, an accuracy of 93.99% ± 1.78%, an F1-score of 93.97% ± 1.78%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 87.99% ± 3.56%, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 93.97% ± 1.78%.

We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length. Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice.

Uniquely, they have a log Gaussian volume distribution and are produced from megakaryocytes, large cells that have polyploid nuclei. In this Hypothesis, we propose that a possible explanation for the origin of megakaryocytes and platelets is that, ∼220 million years ago, an inheritable change occurred in a mammalian ancestor that caused the haemostatic cell line of the animal to become polyploid. This inheritable change occurred specifically in the genetic programme of the cell lineage from which the haemostatic cell originated and led, because of increase in cell size, to its fragmentation into cytoplasmic particles (platelets) in the pulmonary circulatory system, as found in modern mammals.

By drawing on intertextual qualitative source analysis, it locates the policing of the Indignados’ protests on the continuum determined by the antinomic ideal types of escalated force and negotiated management very close to the former. It aims to explain what was behind the use of escalated force by the Spanish law enforcement agencies against the 15-M Movement. Although the Indignados’ goals were not undemocratic, they were treated and fought by the law enforcement agencies precisely as criminals threatening democracy, Spain, and Spaniards. The major argument is that treating the protest movement as the enemy that had to be suppressed might have been a defense mechanism of militant democracy. Transforming the Indignados into the enemy might have resulted from fears of threatening the existing status quo and losing political elites’ own state positions. © 2022 Schedes.

The PSO brings in a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying out multi-objective optimization in large dimensions, capability for multiple CF generation, and setting box constraints or immutability of data attributes. An algorithm is proposed that incorporates these features and it enables greater control over the proximity and sparsity properties over the generated CFs.

However, its interpretability has been lacking of concrete research. Improving the stability of the feature selection method is a way to effectively improve its interpretability. A novel feature selection approach named Interpretable Particle Swarm Optimization is developed in this paper. It uses four data perturbation ways and three filter feature selection methods to obtain stable feature subsets, and adopts Fuch map to convert them to initial particles. Besides, it employs similarity mutation strategy, which applies Tanimoto distance to choose the nearest 1/3 individuals to the previous particles to implement mutation. Eleven representative algorithms and four typical datasets are taken to make a comprehensive comparison with our proposed approach. Accuracy, F1, precision and recall rate indicators are used as classification measures, and extension of Kuncheva indicator is employed as the stability measure. Experiments show that our method has a better interpretability than the compared evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, the results of classification measures demonstrate that the proposed approach has an excellent comprehensive classification performance. © 2022 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

This protection becomes of utmost importance when dealing with victims who have suffered injuries because of crime. For this reason, both India and Ukraine have given special protection to victims’ rights throughout the criminal process. This paper aims to analyze the role and degree of protection offered by these criminal procedure codes in respecting the rights of victims. Despite all the procedures put in place, the condition of the victim is still questionable, which has considerably affected the credibility of these countries’ criminal procedure codes. To determine whether they really ensure the respect of victims’ rights, a comparative methodology was used to establish the expectations of the two criminal law systems in this matter. The findings suggest that even though the criminal procedure codes of both countries have relevant provisions to protect the victims’ rights, their criminal procedure systems are still marred with issues regarding this aspect. Consequently, there is a need to revisit these codes to ensure that the rights of parties, especially those of the victims, are respected. © 2022, Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

The current study adopts an aural receptive vocabulary test to measure L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge and a listening task to measure their L2 listening comprehension proficiency. The results show that L2 learners’ aural vocabulary knowledge significantly correlates with their listening proficiency. Although learners’ aural word knowledge at each frequency level (from 1K to 5K) and their academic word knowledge were significantly correlated with L2 listening, the strongest correlation was between academic vocabulary knowledge and listening, followed by that between word knowledge at the 5K frequency level and listening. In terms of the contribution of aural vocabulary knowledge to L2 listening, the scores achieved for the academic word knowledge measure alone explain 22% of the variance in L2 listening, and the scores achieved for the 5K word frequency level measure alone explain 16.7% of such variance.

ExpGA employs the explanation results generated by interpretable methods to collect high-quality initial seeds, which are prone to derive discriminatory samples by slightly modifying feature values. ExpGA then adopts GA to search discriminatory sample candidates by optimizing a fitness value. Benefiting from this combination of explanation results and GA, ExpGA is both efficient and effective to detect discriminatory individuals. Moreover, ExpGA only requires prediction probabilities of the tested model, resulting in a better generalization capability to various models. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets, show that ExpGA presents higher efficiency and effectiveness than four state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 ACM.","Explanation result; fairness testing; genetic algorithm","Efficiency; AI systems; Critical attributes; Diverse methods; Explanation result; Fairness testing; Feature values; Fitness values; Generalization capability; High quality; Prediction probabilities; Genetic algorithms","IEEE Computer Society","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","44th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2022","22 May 2022 through 27 May 2022","Pittsburgh","180255","02705257","978-145039221-1","PCSED","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131370347"

The optimal timing for non-infarct-related artery revascularization – immediate versus staged – has not been investigated adequately. Aim: We aimed to assess clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease using immediate versus staged non-infarct-related artery revascularization. Methods: Outcomes were analysed in patients from the randomized FLOWER-MI trial, in whom, after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention, non-culprit lesions were assessed using fractional flow reserve or angiography during the index procedure or during a staged procedure during the initial hospital stay, ≤ 5 days after the index procedure. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and unplanned hospitalization with urgent revascularization at 1 year. Results: Among 1171 patients enrolled in this study, 1119 (96.2%) had complete revascularization performed during a staged procedure, and 44 (3.8%) at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention. During follow-up, a primary outcome event occurred in one of the patients (2.3%) with an immediate strategy and in 55 patients (4.9%) with a staged strategy (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.39–12.69; P = 0.64). Conclusions: Staged non-infarct-related artery complete revascularization was the strategy preferred by investigators in practice in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease. This strategy was not superior to immediate revascularization, which, in the context of this trial, was used in a small proportion of patients. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these observational findings. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Acute myocardial infarction; Fractional flow reserve; Multivessel disease","Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Flowers; Fractional Flow Reserve, Myocardial; Humans; Myocardial Revascularization; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Treatment Outcome; adult; all cause mortality; angiography; artery formation (physiology); Article; cause of death; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; controlled study; female; follow up; fractional flow reserve; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; percutaneous coronary intervention; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; adverse event; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; flower; fractional flow reserve; heart muscle revascularization; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; treatment outcome","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","","","","","","18752136","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137635866"

This article assesses their role in the EU’s system of differentiated integration. To that end, it advances a model based on rational choice theory, outlining the steps and conditions under which tolerated arrangements of de facto differentiation can emerge. This is illustrated in three case studies in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): (1) Sweden’s de facto opt-out from EMU; (2) Kosovo’s adoption of the euro as sole legal tender, and (3) the Fiscal Compact. Data was gathered via document analysis and 11 expert interviews. The article concludes that de facto differentiation may constitute a viable alternative and useful means to make EU integration more flexible if strong national demand for differentiation meets the need for discretion or timely, pragmatic action. © 2022 The Author(s).

Designing seizure prediction models involves defining the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between inter-ictal brain activity and the seizure discharge. This period is typically a fixed interval, with some recent studies reporting the evaluation of different patient-specific pre-ictal intervals. Recently, researchers have aimed to determine the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between regular brain activity and a seizure. Authors have been using deep learning models given the ability of such models to automatically perform pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and handling temporal and spatial dependencies. As these approaches create black-box models, clinicians may not have sufficient trust to use them in high-stake decisions. By considering these problems, we developed an evolutionary seizure prediction model that identifies the best set of features while automatically searching for the pre-ictal period and accounting for patient comfort. This methodology provides patient-specific interpretable insights, which might contribute to a better understanding of seizure generation processes and explain the algorithm’s decisions. We tested our methodology on 238 seizures and 3687 h of continuous data, recorded on scalp recordings from 93 patients with several types of focal and generalised epilepsies. We compared the results with a seizure surrogate predictor and obtained a performance above chance for 32% patients. We also compared our results with a control method based on the standard machine learning pipeline (pre-processing, feature extraction, classifier training, and post-processing), where the control marginally outperformed our approach by validating 35% of the patients. In total, 54 patients performed above chance for at least one method: our methodology or the control one. Of these 54 patients, 21 (≈ 38%) were solely validated by our methodology, while 24 (≈ 44%) were only validated by the control method. These findings may evidence the need for different methodologies concerning different patients. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Algorithms; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Seizures; algorithm; drug resistant epilepsy; electroencephalography; epilepsy; human; procedures; seizure","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126221924"

Unlike optical images, the current object detection methods have the problem of weak feature representation due to the low object resolution in SAR images. In addition, disturbed by chaotic noise, the features of classification and location are prone to significant differences, resulting in classification and location task misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel SAR ship target detection algorithm based on Cross-Attention Mechanism (CAM), which can establish the information interaction between the classification and localization task and strengthen the correlation between features through attention. In addition, to suppress the noise in multi-scale feature fusion, we designed an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module (AFFM), which uses the attention information between channels to perform the re-weighting operation. This operation can enhance useful feature information and suppress noise information. Experimental results show that on a benchmark SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), the Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone network was optimized to improve AP by 6.5% and computational cost by 0.51%.

With the recent increased interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the issue of how metaheuristics interact with XAI has attracted much attention. Most metaheuristics have stochastic search processes, and the jaguar algorithm (JA) is a unique algorithm that has exact search paths. JA shows potential abilities both in exploration and exploitation, but still faces limitations. Therefore, this study proposes a new metaheuristic based on JA and invents precision hunting behavior (PH-JA), which inherits the concept of JA and significantly strengthens its search efficiency. PH-JA improves the solution quality by adaptively detecting the current environment's trends during movement and precisely hunting prey. Then, PH-JA makes the best of the historical information to reduce the computational cost. PH-JA is an explainable metaheuristic and has systematic operational procedures in that each movement is performed according to the present situation rather than random elements. Therefore, the path to a solution is interpretable and can return the same result with the same input. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of PH-JA, which is better than other classical and state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and evaluation costs.  © 2022 IEEE.","Evolutionary Computation; Explainable AI; Jaguar Algorithm; Metaheuristics","Biomimetics; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Complex optimization problems; Explainable AI; Exploration and exploitation; Hunting behavior; Jaguar algorithm; Metaheuristic; Potential ability; Search efficiency; Solution quality; Stochastic search process; Stochastic systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMC)","2022 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2022","9 October 2022 through 12 October 2022","Prague","184497","1062922X","978-166545258-8","PICYE","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142743537"

However, whether such benefits are similarly observed in those receiving complex procedures is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the benefits of prasugrel dose de-escalation therapy are maintained in the complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) subgroup. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a post hoc analysis of the HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS trial, a randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, multicenter trial performed at 35 hospitals in South Korea. Study participants included patients with ACS who were receiving PCI. Data were collected from September 30, 2014, to December 18, 2015, and analyzed from September 17, 2020, to June 15, 2021. Interventions and Exposures: Patients were randomized to a prasugrel dose de-escalation (5 mg daily) at 1 month post-PCI group or a conventional (10 mg daily) group. Complex PCI was defined as having at least 1 of the following features: 3 or more stents implanted, 3 or more lesions treated, bifurcation PCI, total stent length 60 mm or larger, left main PCI, or heavy calcification. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main analysis end points were MACE (major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and repeat revascularization) at 1 year for ischemic outcomes, and BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) class 2 or higher bleeding events at 1 year for bleeding outcomes. Results: Of 2271 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [9.0] years; 2024 [89%] male patients) for whom full procedural data were available, 705 patients received complex PCI, and 1566 patients received noncomplex PCI. Complex PCI was associated with higher rates of ischemic outcomes but not with bleeding outcomes. Prasugrel dose de-escalation did not increase the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.47-1.66; P =.70 in complex PCI; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.45-1.46; P =.48 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.84) but decreased BARC class 2 or higher bleeding events (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.61; P =.002 in complex PCI; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.00; P =.05 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.08), albeit with wide 95% CIs.

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly complicated but essential to provide interpretations for outlier detection results in high-dimensional space as a consequence of the large number of features. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new model based on a Variational AutoEncoder and Genetic Algorithm (VAEGA) for detecting outliers in subspaces of high-dimensional data. The proposed model employs a neural network to create a probabilistic dimensionality reduction variational autoencoder (VAE) that applies its low-dimensional hidden space to characterize the high-dimensional inputs. Then, the hidden vector is sampled randomly from the hidden space to reconstruct the data so that it closely matches the input data. The reconstruction error is then computed to determine an outlier score, and samples exceeding the threshold are tentatively identified as outliers. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a basis for examining and analyzing the abnormal subspace of the outlier set obtained by the VAE layer. After encoding the outlier dataset’s subspaces, the degree of anomaly for the detected subspaces is calculated using the redefined fitness function. Finally, the abnormal subspace is calculated for the detected point by selecting the subspace with the highest degree of anomaly. The clustering of abnormal subspaces helps filter outliers that are mislabeled (false positives), and the VAE layer adjusts the network weights based on the false positives. When compared to other methods using five public datasets, the VAEGA outlier detection model results are highly interpretable and outperform or have competitive performance compared to current contemporary methods. © 2022 by the authors.","abnormal subspace; genetic algorithm; outlier detection; variational autoencoder","Anomaly detection; Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Network layers; Signal encoding; Statistics; Vector spaces; Vectors; Abnormal subspace; Auto encoders; Curse of dimensionality; E- commerces; False positive; High dimensional data; High dimensional spaces; Model-based OPC; Outlier Detection; Variational autoencoder; Genetic algorithms","MDPI","","","","","","19994893","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148726985"

The research was based on two-year hourly data concentrations of inorganic gaseous pollutants, particulate matter, benzene, toluene, m, p-xylenes, total nonmethane hydrocarbons, and meteorological parameters obtained from the Global Data Assimilation System. In order to determine the model that will be capable of achieving a superior level of performance, eight metaheuristics algorithms were tested for eXtreme Gradient Boosting optimization, while the relative SHapley Additive exPlanations values were used to estimate the relative importance of each pollutant level and meteorological parameter for the prediction of benzene concentrations. According to the results, benzene levels are mostly shaped by toluene and the finest aerosol fraction concentrations, in the environment governed by temperature, volumetric soil moisture content, and momentum flux direction, as well as by levels of total nonmethane hydrocarbons and total nitrogen oxide. The types of conditions which provided the environment for the impact of toluene, the finest aerosol, and temperature on benzene dynamics are distinguished and described. © 2023 by the authors.","benzene; BTEX; explainable artificial intelligence; extreme gradient boosting; machine learning; metaheuristics; swarm intelligence; volatile organic compounds","Aerosols; Heuristic algorithms; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Swarm intelligence; Volatile organic compounds; BTEX; Environmental fate; Explainable artificial intelligence; Extreme gradient boosting; Fine aerosols; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Meteorological parameters; Non-methane hydrocarbons; aerosol; artificial intelligence; benzene; BTEX; concentration (composition); environmental fate; heuristics; machine learning; modeling; optimization; volatile organic compound; Optimization","MDPI","","","","","","20734433","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146824348"

Accurate prediction of solar radiation is an important prerequisite for ensuring power grid security and electricity market transactions. The current mainstream solar radiation prediction method is the deep learning method, and the structure design and data selection of the deep learning method determine the prediction accuracy and speed of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) model based on the attention mechanism and genetic algorithm (AGA-LSTM). The attention mechanism is used to assign different weights to each feature, so that the model can focus more attention on the key features. Meanwhile, the structure and data selection parameters of the model are optimized through genetic algorithms, and the time series memory and processing capabilities of LSTM are used to predict the global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance after 5, 10, and 15 min. The proposed AGA-LSTM model was trained and tested with two years of data from the public database Solar Radiation Research Laboratory site of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The experimental results show that under the three prediction scales, the prediction performance of the AGA-LSTM model is below 20%, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy compared with the continuous model and some public methods. © 2022 by the authors.

However, most of the main DR methods are either linear (e.g., PCA), do not provide an explicit mapping between the original data and its lower-dimensional representation (e.g., MDS, t-SNE, isomap), or produce mappings that cannot be easily interpreted (e.g., kernel PCA, neural-based autoencoder). Recently genetic programming (GP) has been used to evolve interpretable DR mappings in the form of symbolic expressions. There exists a number of ways in which GP can be used to this end and no study exists that performs a comparison. In this paper, we fill this gap by comparing existing GP methods as well as devising new ones. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark datasets based on predictive accuracy and on how well the original features can be reconstructed using the lower-dimensional representation only. Finally we qualitatively assess the resulting expressions and their complexity. We find that various GP methods can be competitive with state-of-the-art DR algorithms and that they have the potential to produce interpretable DR mappings.  © 2022 ACM.","Dimensionality reduction; genetic programming; interpretability; unsupervised learning","Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Auto encoders; Data exploration; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Fitness functions; Interpretability; Isomaps; Kernel PCA; Low-dimensional representation; Symbolic expression; Genetic programming","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","","978-145039237-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135204491"

Nevertheless, interpreting complex opaque models is not trivial. Current interpretability approaches rely on local explanations or produce long explanations that tend to overload the user's cognitive abilities. In this paper, we address this problem by extracting interpretable, transparent models from opaque ones via a new readability-enhanced multi-objective Genetic Programming approach called REMO-GP. To achieve that, we adapt text readability metrics into model complexity proxies that support evaluating ML interpretability. We demonstrate that our approach can generate global interpretable models that mimic the decisions of complex opaque models over several datasets, while keeping model complexity low. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Binary Classification; Genetic Programming; Interpretability; Opaque Models","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Genetic algorithms; 'current; Binary classification; Classification models; Cognitive ability; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Modeling complexity; Multi objective; Opaque model; Genetic programming","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS); Nanyang Technology Unversity Singapore; National University of Singapore (NUS); Singapore Management University (SMU)","2022 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2022","4 December 2022 through 7 December 2022","Singapore","186443","","978-166548768-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147792834"

This is especially true for high-stakes areas such as real estate valuation. Unfortunately, the methods applied there often exhibit a trade-off between accuracy and explainability. One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision is supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting in accuracy. The unexplainable machine learning approaches are often observed to provide higher accuracy but are not scrutable in their decision-making. In this paper, we apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to CBR predictors in order to improve their performance. In particular, we deploy EAs to the similarity functions (used in CBR to find comparable cases), which are fitted to the data set at hand. As a consequence, we achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), while keeping interpretability and explainability. These results stem from our empirical evaluation on a large data set of real estate offers where we compare known similarity functions, their EA-improved counterparts, and DNNs. Surprisingly, DNNs are only on par with standard CBR techniques. However, using EA-learned similarity functions does yield an improved performance.  © 2022 ACM.","case-based reasoning; Evolutionary algorithms; neural networks; real estate valuation","Decision making; Deep neural networks; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Casebased reasonings (CBR); High standards; High-accuracy; Human lives; Machine learning approaches; Neural-networks; Performance; Real estate valuations; Similarity functions; Trade off; Case based reasoning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","","978-145039237-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135214921"

Understanding the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-perceived symptom severity in psoriasis is key to clinical decision-making. Objectives: This post hoc analysis of the PSO-LONG trial data assessed the impact of long-term proactive or reactive management with fixed-dose combination calcipotriene 50 µg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g (Cal/BD) foam on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: Five hundred and twenty-one patients from the Phase 3, randomized, double-blind PSO-LONG trial were included. An initial 4-week, open-label phase of fixed-dose combination Cal/BD foam once daily (QD) was followed by a 52-week maintenance phase, at the start of which patients were randomized to a proactive management arm (Cal/BD foam twice weekly) or reactive management arm (vehicle foam twice weekly). Patient-perceived symptom severity and HRQoL were assessed using the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the EuroQol-5D for psoriasis (EQ-5D-5L-PSO). Results: Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed across all PRO measures. The mean difference (standard deviation) from baseline to Week 4 was −8.97 (6.18) for PSI, −6.02 (5.46) for DLQI and 0.11 (0.15) for EQ-5D-5L-PSO scores. During maintenance, patients receiving reactive management had significantly higher DLQI (15% [p = 0.007]) and PSI (15% [p = 0.0128]) and a numerically lower EQ-5D-5L-PSO mean area under the curve score than patients receiving proactive management (1% [p = 0.0842]). Conclusions: Cal/BD foam significantly improved DLQI, EQ-5D-5L-PSO and PSI scores during the open-label and maintenance phases. Patients assigned to proactive management had significantly better DLQI and PSI scores and numerically better EQ-5D-5L-PSO versus reactive management. Additionally, baseline flare was associated with worse PROs than the start of a relapse, and patients starting a relapse also had worse PROs than patients in remission. © 2021 The Authors.

Forty Chinese learners of English studying in a UK university participated in the study. L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge was measured through a receptive aural vocabulary test and their grammar knowledge was measured through an aural grammar test. The Cambridge Preliminary English Test (PET) listening section was adopted to measure L2 learners’ listening comprehension proficiency. Results from correlation analysis showed that both vocabulary and grammar measures correlated with L2 listening (r =.65 and r =.74, respectively). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the vocabulary and grammar measures jointly explained 65.7% of the variance in the listening score and that each measure made a unique contribution. It was also found that the grammar measure explained more of the variance in L2 listening than the vocabulary measure. These results demonstrate the importance of good L2 vocabulary and grammar knowledge in benefiting learners’ LC. © 2023, Universidad de Granada.

However, the surgery effect on bleeding rates and other clinical joint outcomes can be unclear. Aim: To investigate the effects of joint surgery on joint annualized bleeding rates (JABRs) and physical health outcomes in patients with haemophilia A undergoing N8-GP prophylaxis. Methods: Patients in the pathfinder 2 trial received N8-GP prophylaxis, enrolling in the pathfinder 3 trial for indicated surgery. Patients returned to pathfinder 2 post-surgery, continuing N8-GP prophylaxis until end-of-trial. JABRs were calculated from bleeding across all joints for pre-surgery (immediately before surgery) and post-surgery (to pathfinder 2 study end) periods. Joint-health-related outcomes were derived from patient records. Results: Data (41 joint surgeries; n = 30) were analysed statistically using datamining and descriptively. Pre-surgery mean JABR was higher in patients who later were operated than in 146 non-operated patients (p =.004). In operated patients, mean JABR decreased from 1.33 pre-surgery to.37 post-surgery (p =.011). In all but three patients, JABR improved or remained the same post-surgery. In the three patients whose JABR remained at one (all with multiple joint arthropathy), post-surgery bleeds were mostly at non-operated sites. Two of the three patients whose JABR increased post-surgery had undergone surgery for reasons unlikely to improve JABR. Mobility parameters often improved in patients whose JABR remained at zero. Conclusion: Patients with haemophilia treated with N8-GP prophylaxis benefit from surgeries. However, this analysis could not differentiate the relative contributions of surgical interventions and prophylactic treatment to the improvement of JABR. © 2021 The Authors.

Some recent advances in XAI are based on Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques, such as Genetic Programming. We call this trend EC for XAI. We argue that the full potential of EC methods has not been fully exploited yet in XAI, and call the community for future efforts in this field. Likewise, we find that there is a growing concern in EC regarding the explanation of population-based methods, i.e., their search process and outcomes. While some attempts have been done in this direction (although, in most cases, those are not explicitly put in the context of XAI), we believe that there are still several research opportunities and open research questions that, in principle, may promote a safer and broader adoption of EC in real-world applications. We call this trend XAI within EC. In this position paper, we briefly overview the main results in the two above trends, and suggest that the EC community may play a major role in the achievement of XAI. © 2022 ACM.","evolutionary computation; explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; optimization","Calculations; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; AI applications; Computation methods; Evolutionary computation techniques; Explainable artificial intelligence; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Research communities; Research opportunities; Research questions; Search process; Machine learning","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","181031","","978-145039268-6","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136333389"

Methods: We evaluated data from three Phase 2/3 clinical trials conducted in Liberia (PREVAIL), Guinea (FLW), and Sierra Leone (STRIVE) during the 2013–2016 West African EVD outbreak to assess immune responses using validated assays. We performed a post hoc analysis of the association of vaccine response with sex, age (18–50 yrs & >50 yrs), and baseline (BL) GP-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titer (<200 & ≥200 EU/mL), including individual study (PREVAIL, FLW, or STRIVE) data and pooled data from all 3 studies. The endpoints were total IgG antibody response (EU/mL) measured by the GP-ELISA and neutralizing antibody response measured by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP at Days 28, 180, and 365 postvaccination. Results: In the overall pooled population, in all subgroups, and in each trial independently, GP-ELISA and PRNT geometric mean titers increased from BL, generally peaking at Day 28 and persisting through Day 365. Immune responses were greater in women and participants with BL GP-ELISA ≥ 200 EU/mL, but did not differ across age groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP elicits a robust and durable immune response through 12 months postvaccination in participants regardless of age, sex, or BL GP-ELISA titer. The higher immune responses observed in women and participants with pre-existing immunity are consistent with those described previously and for other vaccines.

The CSI signals collected by different fingerprint points have a high degree of discrimination due to the influence of multi-path effects. This multi-path effect is reflected in the correlation between subcarriers and anten-nas. However, in mining such correlations, previous methods are difficult to aggregate non-adjacent features, resulting in insufficient multi-path information extraction. In addition, the existence of the multi-path effect makes the relationship between the original CSI signal and the distance not obvious, and it is easy to cause mismatching of long-distance points. Therefore, this paper proposes an indoor localization algorithm that combines the multi-head self-attention mechanism and effective CSI (MHSA-EC). This algorithm is used to solve the problem where it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively aggregate long-distance CSI features and mismatches of long-distance points. This paper verifies the stability and accuracy of MHSA-EC positioning through a large number of experiments. The average positioning error of MHSA-EC is 0.71 m in the comprehensive office and 0.64 m in the laboratory. © 2022 by the authors.

However most real-world optimisation problems consist of nonlinear problems with complex constraints and conflicting objectives. The process by which a GA arrives at a solution remains largely unexplained to the end-user. A poorly understood solution will dent the confidence a user has in the arrived at solution. We propose that investigation of the variables that strongly influence solution quality and their relationship would be a step toward providing an explanation of the near-optimal solution presented by a metaheuristic. Through the use of four benchmark problems we use the population data generated by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to train a surrogate model, and investigate the learning of the search space by the surrogate model. We compare what the surrogate has learned after being trained on population data generated after the first generation and contrast this with a surrogate model trained on the population data from all generations. We show that the surrogate model picks out key characteristics of the problem as it is trained on population data from each generation. Through mining the surrogate model we can build a picture of the learning process of a GA, and thus an explanation of the solution presented by the GA.

To what extent do they do so as a result of various bureaucratic and fiscal incentives? The literature has documented several explanatory frameworks in the context of China that predominantly focus on the realm of developmental policies. Owing to the salient characteristics of the social policy arena, local adaptation of centrally designed policies may operate on distinctive logics. This study synthesizes the recent scholarship on subnational social policymaking and explains the significant interregional disparities in China's de facto urban poverty line - the eligibility standard of the urban minimum livelihood guarantee scheme, or dibao. Five research hypotheses are formulated for empirical examination: fiscal power effect, population effect, fiscal dependency effect, province effect and neighbour effect. Quantitative analysis of provincial-level panel data largely endorses the hypotheses. The remarkable subnational variations in dibao standards are explained by a salient constellation of fiscal and political factors that are embedded within the country's complex intergovernmental relations and fiscal arrangements. Both a race-to-the-top and a race-to-the-bottom may be fostered by distinctive mechanisms. The unique role of provincial governments as intermediary agents within China's political apparatus is illuminated in the social policy arena.

The research uses data from Eseb (2002 – 2018) and Lapop (2010 – 2019). The results indicate that: 1) there is an increase in polarization, but it is predominantly affective and more intense in relation to the candidates; 2) although there are already some signs in 2014, affective polarization is much more visible in 2018; 3) in ideology, evidence indicates a growth and radicalization of the right, which may eventually contribute to a polarization. Given this evidence, it is concluded that the specific characteristics of Brazilian polarization are related to aspects of our political context, both long-term, such as the reduced social base of the parties, and more recent ones, such as the reorganization of the right and moderation of PT. In common with other countries, there is, in Brazil, the concentration of polarization in politically engaged individuals. © 2022, Opiniao Publica.

Current target-generic methods typically disentangle identity features in the latent space, using adversarial training to balance privacy and utility. However, this pattern often leads to a trade-off between privacy and utility, and the latent space remains difficult to explain. To address these issues, we propose IDeudemon, which employs a ""divide and conquer""strategy to protect identity and preserve utility step by step while maintaining good explainability. In Step I, we obfuscate the 3D disentangled ID code calculated by a parametric NeRF model to protect identity. In Step II, we incorporate visual similarity assistance and train a GAN with adjusted losses to preserve image utility. Thanks to the powerful 3D prior and delicate generative designs, our approach could protect the identity naturally, produce high quality details and is robust to different poses and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IDeudemon outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.","","Computer vision; 'current; De-identification; Divide-and-conquer; Generative design; Generic method; High quality; Trade off; True identity; Two step method; Visual similarity; Economic and social effects","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2023","2 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Paris","196783","15505499","979-835030718-4","PICVE","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185877516"

To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success. © 2023 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; explainable computational intelligence; explainable decision support systems; explainergy; metaheuristics","Artificial intelligence; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Complex energy; Energy domain; Energy fields; Explainable computational intelligence; Explainable decision support system; Explainergy; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic optimization; Performance; Performance of algorithm; Decision support systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2023","5 December 2023 through 8 December 2023","Mexico City","196107","","978-166543065-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182921578"

Our analysis rejects the explanation of confidence in women’s organizations taking these cultural regions as the subject of analysis, so we take countries and individuals as units of analysis. We present several multilevel models whose results show that postmaterialist values continue to be significant in explaining the variance in trust toward women’s organizations between countries. At the individual level, sex, age, educational level, income, family size, attendance at religious services, political ideology and the use of new media also help to explain the greater or less trust in women’s organizations.

According to our literature review, the economic environment in which the adjustment takes place matters. Also, the composition of the adjustment seems to be relevant to its effectiveness, with expenditure-based plans being less contractionary (or even expansionary) than tax-based plans. Our purpose is to understand, through a VAR model, which path the Portuguese economy would have followed without the EAP. Our results suggest that the austerity programme may have been harmful to economic activity in the short run, but in a longer horizon it produced a better outcome than if the EAP had not been implemented. In the absence of the EAP, the tax to GDP ratio would have been below the current ratio, with the inverse happening for the primary public expenditure ratio and for the public debt interest rate. Overall, our results support the likelihood of less disciplined fiscal accounts in the absence of the EAP. © 2022, Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra.

While training on ever-larger portions of the internet leads to consistent performance improvements, the size of these improvements diminishes with scale, and there has been little work exploring the effect of data selection on pre-training and downstream performance beyond simple de-duplication methods such as MinHash. Here, we show that careful data selection (on top of de-duplicated data) via pre-trained model embeddings can speed up training (20% efficiency gains) and improves average downstream accuracy on 16 NLP tasks (up to 2%) at the 6.7B model scale. Furthermore, we show that repeating data intelligently consistently outperforms baseline training (while repeating random data performs worse than baseline training). Our results indicate that clever data selection can significantly improve LLM pre-training, calls into question the common practice of training for a single epoch on as much data as possible, and demonstrates a path to keep improving our models past the limits of randomly sampling web data. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Genetic Programming is usually utilised to handle UCARP by evolving effective routing policies, which can respond to the uncertain environment in real-time. Previous studies mainly focus on the effectiveness of the routing policies but ignore the interpretability. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc interpretability, which explains a pre-trained complex routing policy. Unlike the existing explanation methods for classification/regression models, the behaviour of a routing policy is characterised as a ranking process rather than predicting a single output. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Local Ranking Explanation (LRE) method for GP-evolved routing policies for UCARP. Given a UCARP decision situation, LRE trains a linear model that gives the same ranks of the candidate tasks as those of the explained routing policy. The experimental results demonstrate that LRE can obtain more interpretable linear models that have highly correlated and consistent behaviours with the original routing policy in most decision situations. By analysing coefficients and attribute importance of the linear model, we managed to provide a local explanation of the original routing policy in a decision situation.  © 2022 ACM.","Genetic Programming; Hyper-Heuristic; Local explanation; Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Network routing; Capacitated arc routing problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Decision situation; Hyper-heuristics; Interpretability; Linear modeling; Local explanation; Real-world; Routing policies; Uncertain capacitated arc routing problem; Genetic programming","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGEVO","2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2022","9 July 2022 through 13 July 2022","Virtual, Online","180742","","978-145039237-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135225263"

The aim of this research is to identify the different scenarios of electoral success for radical right parties in ten European countries between 2008 and 2019. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) - a case-oriented technique which allows indepth comparative examination and which is based on the concepts of equifinality and causal heterogeneity -, we test the role of several causal conditions related to some demand-side and supply-side explanations. Our results reveal four sufficient causal paths that lead to the success of these parties, which confirm that they are able to achieve relevance in quite diverse contexts. The four paths combine both demand-side and supply-side conditions, but the role of the latter is qualitatively and quantitatively more important. In particular, we see how radical right parties can effectively take advantage of favorable political competitive dynamics, even in the absence of a priori favorable socio-economic contexts. Overall, our findings run contrary to some mechanistic explanations in the literature and support the idea of conceiving of the radical right parties as a complex, multiform phenomenon which needs to be understood through both theoretical and methodological innovations. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The Simplified Psoriasis Index (SPI) is a summary score with separate components for current severity (SPI-s), psychosocial impact (SPI-p), and past history and interventions (SPI-i). It is available in two similar versions: proSPI and saSPI. Aim: To assess the validity of the SPI by studying its correlation to the benchmark scores in Tunisian patients. Methods: It was a prospective bicentric study including 80 patients with plaque psoriasis. Results: The median PASI was 7.6 and the median DLQI was 9. The median proSPI-s was 6 and the median saSPI-s was 8. The median SPI-p was 7. The median SPI-i was 2. There was a strong correlation between the proSPI-s and PASI (r=0.87) and between the proSPI-s and saSPI-s (r=0.82). There was a medium correlation between saSPI-s and PASI (r=0.70) and between SPI-p and DLQI (r=0.67). The threshold value for proSPI-s and saSPI-s was 7.25. The threshold value for SPI-p was 6.5. Conclusion: The SPI aims to provide a concise but global measure of the severity and impact of psoriasis on quality of life. The use of SPI has several advantages: the simplicity of use, the additional weight given to critical locations of psoriasis, the possibility for the patient to self-assess his own disease, and the possibility of evaluating all the dimensions of psoriasis at the same time. © 2022 Maison du Medicine.

Using on-chain data, this study identifies a misalignment in the economic incentive structure of the blockchain protocol as a key contributor to the de-pegging. It is found that an undercompensation of UST when it was redeemed played a significant role in the de-pegging event, with the UST price on cryptocurrency exchanges following the redeemed value of UST that users could obtain by swapping UST for LUNA and selling it on the market. The results highlight the importance of properly designing the incentive structure of blockchain protocols to ensure their sustainability and security. © 2023 the Author(s)","","","University Library System, University of Pittsburgh","","","","","","23795980","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159438464"

By segmenting myocardium DE-MRI images, it provides critical information for the evaluation and treatment of myocardial infarction. As a consequence, it is vital to investigate the segmentation and classification technique of myocardial DE-MRI. Methods: Firstly, an end-to-end minimally supervised and semi-supervised semantic DE-MRI myocardial fibrosis segmentation framework is proposed, which combines image classification and semantic segmentation branches based on the self-attention mechanism. Following that, a residual hole network fused with the dual attention mechanism was built, and a double attention metabolic pathway classification method for cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI images was developed. Results: By adding pixel-level labels to an extra 40 training images, the segmentation model may enhance semantic segmentation performance by 2.6 percent (from 61.2 percent to 63.8 percent). When the number of pixel-level labels is increased to 80, semi-supervised feature extraction increases by 4.7 percent when compared to weakly guided semantic segmentation. Adding an attention mechanism to the critical network DRN (Deep Residual Network) can increase the classifier's performance by a small amount. Experiments revealed that the models worked effectively. Conclusion: This paper investigates the segmentation and classification of cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI data using a semi-supervised semantic segmentation and dual attention mechanism, dealing with the issue that existing segmentation algorithms have difficulty segmenting myocardial fibrosis tissue. In the future, we can consider optimizing the design of the attention module to reduce the module computation. © 2022","Cardiac Image Classification; DE-MRI; Dual Attention Mechanism; Myocardial Fibrosis; Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","Algorithms; Fibrosis; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Semantics; Cardiology; Heart; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pixels; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Cardiac image classification; Cardiac images; Delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; Dual attention mechanism; Images classification; Myocardial fibrosis; Semantic segmentation; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised semantic segmentation; Article; classification algorithm; controlled study; convolutional neural network; delayed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; entropy; feature extraction; heart muscle fibrosis; human; human tissue; image analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; segmentation algorithm; semantics; algorithm; fibrosis; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; semantics; Image classification","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","01692607","","CMPBE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136014699"

Aim: To assess long-term efficacy and pharmacokinetic outcomes with fixed-dose N8-GP prophylaxis. Methods: Descriptive analyses were performed on data from the pathfinder 2 and pathfinder 5 trials of patients with severe haemophilia A. Bleed frequency and reoccurrence were assessed in relation to several clinical criteria of interest. Bleed risk relative to time since last dose was assessed using calculated annualised bleeding rate (ABR). Long-term ABR and mean factor VIII (FVIII) trough levels were assessed in patients who received consistent N8-GP prophylaxis every 4 days (Q4D). Results: During pathfinder 2, 117/136 patients with study-drug exposure of ≥600 days experienced bleeding episodes; 8.6% of bleeds were reoccurring bleeds; bleed reoccurrence decreased over time. For patients who received consistent Q4D prophylaxis across the trial (n = 61), mean ABR decreased from 3.5 bleeds/year (Year 1) to 1.6 bleeds/year (Year 6); mean FVIII trough levels stabilised at approximately 5% (Year 6). Across patients who received prophylaxis at some point during pathfinder 2 (n = 177), 125/126 (99%) reoccurring bleeds were joint bleeds. For patients receiving Q4D prophylaxis, bleeding risk generally increased as the time since the last prophylaxis dose increased. A similar reduction in ABR and stabilisation of trough level was observed in pathfinder 5. Conclusion: Long-term exposure (> 5 years) to fixed-dose N8-GP prophylaxis resulted in a protective haemostatic effect, with reduction in bleed frequency and reoccurrence, and stabilisation of FVIII trough level over time. © 2021 The Authors.
