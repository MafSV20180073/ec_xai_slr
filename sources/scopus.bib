	abstract = {Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are widely applied across various domains, such as education and assessing the technical skills of staff in companies. However, creating such questions manually is challenging and time-consuming, especially for specialized fields. In this paper, we explore how generative large language models (LLMs) can be exploited to generate MCQs from instructional texts that serve as tests for vocational qualification assessment. We focus on two topics—basic first aid and production scheduling in companies—for which we created two datasets of parallel course texts in Spanish and Basque. The manual evaluation reveals that both the open-source Llama3 instructed models (8B and 70B) and the proprietary GPT-4o can generate MCQs of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting for Spanish. No significant differences were observed in performance based on model size or licensing type, with performance rates of 91%, 84%, and 80% for GPT-4o, Llama3-70B, and Llama3-8B, respectively. However, the results for Basque show a marked decline, with performance dropping to 70% for GPT-4o and 59% for Llama3-70B, and a notably low 27% for Llama3-8B. Finally, few-shot generation using Basque-adapted Llama-eus-8B foundational model shows promising potential. ©2025 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.},

	abstract = {Predictive maintenance plays a crucial role in preventing equipment failures and minimizing operational downtime in modern industries. However, traditional predictive maintenance methods often face challenges in adapting to diverse industrial environments and ensuring the transparency and fairness of their predictions. This paper presents a novel predictive maintenance framework that integrates deep learning and optimization techniques while addressing key ethical considerations, such as transparency, fairness, and explainability, in artificial intelligence driven decision-making. The framework employs an Autoencoder for feature reduction, a Convolutional Neural Network for pattern recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory network for temporal analysis. To enhance transparency, the decision-making process of the framework is made interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand and trust the model’s predictions. Additionally, Particle Swarm Optimization is used to refine hyperparameters for optimal performance and mitigate potential biases in the model. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets from different industrial scenarios, with performance validated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time metrics. The results demonstrate an impressive accuracy of up to 99.92% and 99.45% across different datasets, highlighting the framework’s effectiveness in enhancing predictive maintenance strategies. Furthermore, the model’s explainability ensures that the decisions can be audited for fairness and accountability, aligning with ethical standards for critical systems. By addressing transparency and reducing potential biases, this framework contributes to the responsible and trustworthy deployment of artificial intelligence in industrial environments, particularly in safety-critical applications. The results underscore its potential for wide application across various industrial contexts, enhancing both performance and ethical decision-making. Copyright © 2025 The Author.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Management of anorectal cancers requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Recently, large language models have been suggested as potential tools for various applications in health care. OBJECTIVE: Assess suggested management recommendations provided by a generative artificial intelligence chatbot with those of a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team to evaluate applicability in clinical settings. DESIGN: Comparative pilot study where management recommendations from a generative artificial intelligence chatbot for patients with anal or colorectal cancers were compared against historical consensus decisions from multidisciplinary team meetings. SETTING: Single referral tertiary center. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients (mean age of 66.5 years; 53.5% woman) were included; 80% were primarily diagnosed with rectal cancer, predominantly stage II and III disease (46.6%). The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 4 cm. INTERVENTIONS: From a generative artificial intelligence chatbot, we generated management recommendations for each patient, which were subsequently compared to historical decisions from a multidisciplinary team to gauge concordance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included a degree of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the multidisciplinary team decisions, assessed on a scale from 1 (complete disagreement) to 5 (complete agreement), and justification was evaluated by 3 experienced colorectal surgeons. RESULTS: A generative artificial intelligence chatbot achieved a high concordance rate with multidisciplinary team decisions, with an average concordance rating of 4.08. Multidisciplinary team treatment strategies included neoadjuvant therapy for 33.3% of patients, upfront surgery for 26.6%, and further diagnostic assessment for 20%. Interrater agreement on concordance was found to be moderate (κ coefficient range, 0.333-0.577), whereas agreement on decision justification was slight (κ coefficient range, 0.047-0.094). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study with small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a high level of concordance between generative artificial intelligence chatbot recommendations and the decisions from a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team, suggesting the potential of large language models to support clinical decision-making in the management of anal and colorectal cancers.  © The ASCRS 2024.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of the State of Power (SoP) in Battery Management Systems (BMS) is crucial for maximizing battery efficiency, especially in electric cars and renewable energy storage fields. SoP is a crucial metric defining lithium-ion batteries’ power efficiency. Contrary to the State of Charge (SoC), the SoP assessment suggests the battery is being utilized under demanding conditions. This research introduces a new hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLstm) architectures. The predictive performance of the hybrid method is improved even further by utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter adjustment. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, are utilized to understand model predictions and determine the crucial factors influencing SoP. The predictive models underwent training and evaluation using a dataset from NASA, focusing on lithium-ion batteries. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model, incorporating PSO optimization, achieves exceptional accuracy. It yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.09, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.03, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.17, and an R2 value of 98%. Comparing these measures to individual models without PSO, there has been a noticeable improvement. The model's transparency and dependability are increased by using SHAP values, which provide a deep knowledge of the importance of features like battery voltage and current. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for significantly improving SoP predictions in BMS with the use of complex deep learning models optimized using PSO. This improvement can increase battery operation safety, reliability, and efficiency. © 2025},

	abstract = {Achieving the simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility in laser powder bed fused (LPBF-ed) titanium (Ti) is challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional parameter space and interactions between parameters and powders. Herein, a hybrid intelligent framework for process parameter optimization of LPBF-ed Ti with improved ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) was proposed. It combines the data augmentation method (AVG ± EC × SD), the multi-model fusion stacking ensemble learning model (GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost), the interpretable machine learning method and the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NSGA-Ⅱ). The GBDT-BPNN-XGBoost outperforms single models in predicting UTS and EL across the accuracy, generalization ability and stability. The SHAP analysis reveals that laser power (P) is the most important feature affecting both UTS and EL, and it has a positive impact on them when P < 220 W. The UTS and EL of samples fabricated by the optimal process parameters were 718 ± 5 MPa and 27.9 % ± 0.1 %, respectively. The outstanding strength-ductility balance is attributable to the forward stresses in hard α’-martensite and back stresses in soft αm’-martensite induced by the strain gradients of hetero-microstructure. The back stresses strengthen the soft αm’-martensite, improving the overall UTS. The forward stresses stimulate the activation of dislocations in hard α’-martensite and the generation of 〈c + a〉 dislocations, allowing the plastic strain to occur in hard regions and enhancing the overall ductility. This work provides a feasible strategy for multi-objective optimization and valuable insights into tailoring the microstructure for improving mechanical properties. © 2025},

Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates, and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel closed box metaheuristic optimization algorithms for box-constrained, continuous optimization problems automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and differential evolution) on the 5-D closed box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-D instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process.

	abstract = {Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an active research area due to its utility in solving complex search and NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the real world. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary computation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based Evolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained great performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the properties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic search spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity measurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches, including FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal that while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its objective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo’s reflection mechanism yields good objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this finding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that maintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search algorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity indices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective. These results underscore the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation and understanding heuristic search spaces in designing frameworks in LLM-EPS.

However, the CVAE’s latent space is still a black-box, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the latent space and molecular properties. To address this issue, we propose the Interpretable Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE), which introduces a modified loss function that correlates the latent value with molecular properties. ICVAE established a linear mapping between latent variables and molecular properties. This linearity is not only crucial for improving interpretability, by assigning clear semantic meaning to latent dimensions, but also provides a practical advantage. It enables direct manipulation of molecular attributes through simple coordinate shifts in latent space, rather than relying on opaque, black-box optimization algorithms. Our experimental results show that the ICVAE can linearly relate one or multiple molecular properties with the latent value and generate molecules with precise properties by controlling the latent values. The ICVAE’s interpretability allows us to gain insight into the molecular generation process, making it a promising approach in drug discovery and material design. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA), using a large language model (LLM) for optimizing the delivery scheduling process in warehouses of third-party logistics (3PL) companies, within the context of a simplified case study, and to highlight the main directions for implementing this methodology in business realities. Design/methodology/approach: Using a simplified case study of an international 3PL company, this study applies a GA developed in RStudio by LLM to generate test scenarios and input data. The GA was optimized to minimize the time and distance of movement in the process of preparing goods for shipment, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving warehouse delivery scheduling. Findings: The study confirms that the GA, supported by LLM, significantly improves the delivery planning process in the warehouse. Specifically, the implementation of the GA led to notable improvements in scheduling efficiency and a reduction in the distance traveled within the warehouse. These enhancements enable more efficient generation, evaluation and optimization of logistic scenarios. Additionally, the use of LLM greatly facilitates the creation and refinement of complex algorithms like GA, through automation and innovative approaches in logistics. Research limitations/implications: The study highlights limitations related to data quality, the dynamic nature of logistic operations, computational complexity and the need for generalization of results. It also points out the lack of research in business realities that demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the benefits of LLM and GA in practice. Originality/value: This paper makes a significant contribution to the literature by demonstrating the capabilities of advanced technologies such as GA and LLM in 3PL logistics. It presents an innovative approach to optimizing logistic processes, offering perspectives for further innovations and automation in supply chain management. It also indicates new opportunities for 3PL companies in terms of improving operational and cost efficiency, emphasizing the importance of continuously seeking innovative solutions in the face of increasing market demands. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have been developing rapidly to attract significant attention these days. These models have exhibited remarkable abilities in achieving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but the performance depends highly on the quality of prompting. Prompt engineering methods have been promoted for further extending the models' abilities to perform different applications. However, prompt engineering involves crafting input prompts for better accuracy and efficiency, demanding substantial expertise with trial-and-error effort. Automating the prompting process is important and can largely reduce human efforts in building suitable prompts. In this work, we develop a new metaheuristic algorithm to couple the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique and LLMs for prompt optimization. Our approach has some unique features: it can converge within only a small number of iterations (i.e., typically 10–20 iterations) to vastly reduce the expensive LLM usage cost; it can easily be applied to conduct many kinds of tasks owing to its simplicity and efficiency; and most importantly, it does not need to depend so much on the quality of initial prompts, because it can improve the prompts through learning more effectively based on enormous existing data. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments with several types of NLP datasets and compared them to others. The results highlight the importance of coupling metaheuristic search algorithms and LLMs for prompt optimization, proving that the presented approach can be adopted to enhance the performance of LLMs. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Zeolites are crystalline porous materials that have been widely utilized in petrochemical industries as well as sustainable chemistry areas. Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs. Experiments on representative zeolite frameworks show the generation-evaluation-reflection-refinement workflow can perform de novo design of OSDAs with superior generation quality than the pure LLM model, generating candidates consistent with experimentally validated OSDAs and optimizing known OSDAs. © 2025 13th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2025.

To prompt the use of the target linguistic structure, the researcher developed an oral production task. The immediate learner uptake measures and pretest-posttest results were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of both feedback strategies. The analysis comparing the measure of learner uptake indicated a greater number of successful corrections for reformulations. The data from the pretest-posttest measures also suggested that the reformulations group outperformed the elicitations and control group.

Objectives: To evaluate patisiran efficacy and safety in post hoc analysis of the Brazilian subpopulation of APOLLO-B. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) in functional capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included CFB to Month 12 in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. Exploratory endpoints included CFB in cardiac biomarkers and Perugini grade of cardiac uptake during technetium-99m scintigraphy. Results: Forty-two patients enrolled in Brazil (patisiran, n=20; placebo, n=22). Patisiran showed benefit in 6MWT and KCCQ-OS scores vs. placebo; CFB (95% confidence interval [CI]) in 6MWT (median) and KCCQ-OS scores (least squares mean) was –2.0 m (–58.5, 42.9) and 9.37 (1.93, 16.81) points with patisiran vs. –30.1 m (–72.2, 3.5) and 2.62 (–4.68, 9.92) points for placebo. For cardiac biomarkers, the mean fold-change from baseline (95% CI) for N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I was 1.31 (1.06, 1.61) and 1.12 (0.94, 1.34) for patisiran, and 1.71 (1.39, 2.10) and 1.28 (1.08, 1.53) for placebo, respectively. Perugini grade improved in 11/18 (61.1%) and 0/10 evaluable patients with patisiran and placebo, respectively. There were no deaths in the patisiran group vs. 3 in the placebo group. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of patisiran in Brazilian patients with ATTR-CM in APOLLO-B were consistent with those in the global study population.

	abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are interpretable simulation models that represent causal relationships between concepts as a weighted digraph with labeled nodes. They serve to examine a system’s structure (e.g., what concepts are critical to spreading an intervention’s effects?) and long-term behavior (e.g., if we increase fruit availability, how will its consumption change?). When modelers build FCMs by leveraging participants’ knowledge, the resulting participant-built FCMs can be analyzed and interpreted since participants report perceived causality. However, engaging enough knowledgeable participants to construct an FCM can be challenging. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms derive FCMs from data by selecting relationships to maximize a metric such as accuracy, which can produce overly dense FCMs where relationships may not represent valid causal mechanisms—this hinders the critically important interpretability of FCMs. In this paper, we address the need for expert knowledge and the validity of causal mechanisms in FCMs. Specifically, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide algorithms in building FCMs where valid pairs of concepts are connected in the right causal direction and with the correct causal type (increase/decrease). Our approach combines LLMs with CMA-ES, a ubiquitous, state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm. Using three real-world case studies and several LLMs, we show our method successfully (i) learns sparse FCMs that fit the data well and (ii) represents valid causal relationships. Moreover, the learned FCMs are sparser than the corresponding participant-built ones, demonstrating our method may help simplify existing FCMs and selectively includes causal relationships, which is essential to build trustworthy and interpretable FCMs. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Organophosphates (OPs) are highly hazardous chemicals with broad-spectrum toxicity. Traditional in vivo methods for determining OP toxicity are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we developed a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict acute rat toxicity of OPs using two-dimensional molecular and quantum chemical descriptors, optimized through genetic algorithm-based multiple linear regression (GA-MLR). The optimal model demonstrated robust performance with the following statistical parameters: coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7451, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) coefficient (Q2Loo) of 0.6208, external test set coefficient of determination (R2ext) of 0.7360. These metrics indicate excellent generalization and predictive capabilities of the model. Interpretative analysis of the model revealed that NumHDonors and PEOE_VSA were the most significant descriptors influencing OP toxicity. An increase in hydrogen bond donors within OP molecules reduces toxicity, as these donors enhance hydrophilicity, diminishing membrane permeability. Moreover, the PEOE_VSA descriptor characterizes the partial charge properties of OP molecules, reflecting their electrostatic interactions with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) during binding, which influences toxicity. This study presents an optimized modeling strategy designed for small datasets, enabling stable feature selection and accurate assessment of their contributions to toxicity prediction. This research provides a reliable QSAR approach for OP toxicity prediction while offering new insights into toxicity mechanisms. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The increasing energy demands, and environmental concerns necessitate the development of efficient and sustainable cooling technologies, particularly in arid regions such as Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This study aims to optimize the energy efficiency, specifically the Coefficient of Performance (COP), of solar-powered absorption cooling systems using advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. For this purpose, predictive models employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were developed. Subsequently, nature-inspired optimization techniques, including Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were explored to improve the prediction skills. The study utilized three distinct feature combinations to capture various operational and environmental parameters, and the models were evaluated using several statistical metrics. The results demonstrated significant improvements in predictive accuracy with the optimized models. Combination 1 (C1) achieved near-perfect goodness-of-fit values with marginal gains from optimization, while Combination 2 (C2) also showed high values with slight reductions in the optimized models. Similarly, Combination 3 (C3) initially had lower performance. Still, optimization techniques notably improved the goodness-of-fit values, with ANN-CSO showing an 11.46 % increase, ANN-MFOA a 10.36 % increase, and ANN-WOA a 10.54 % increase. Further feature importance using SHAP analysis indicated that the most influential parameters were heat absorption (Qa), heat exchange rate (Qe), cooling capacity (Qc), and heat dissipation (Qd), with solar irradiance (Ir) having a minor impact. These findings indicate that the optimization techniques are particularly effective for feature sets that initially underperform. The study recommends integrating these advanced optimization methods into the design and operation of solar-powered absorption cooling systems to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Future research should explore the scalability and adaptability of these optimized models across different climatic regions, incorporate real-time data, and investigate the economic and long-term stability aspects under various operational scenarios to ensure comprehensive practical implementation and sustainability benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a pivotal role in various domains, including monitoring, security, and data transmission. However, their susceptibility to intrusions poses a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and an ensemble machine learning approach combining Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of intrusion detection in WSNs. The system addresses key challenges such as the imbalanced nature of datasets and the evolving complexity of network attacks. By incorporating Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique Tomek (SMOTE-Tomek) techniques to balance the dataset and employing explainable AI methods such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the proposed model achieves significant improvements in detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score while providing clear, interpretable results. Extensive experimentation on WSN-DS dataset demonstrates the system's efficacy, achieving an accuracy of 99.73%, with precision, recall, and F1 score values of 99.72% each, outperforming existing approaches. This work offers a robust, scalable solution for securing WSNs, contributing to both academic research and practical applications.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The model accounts for ion transport in the battery domain and electrode kinetics at the two electrodes; a negative electrode and a positive electrode. Unlike previous models, the model uses phenomenon-logical, geometry-based function for electrochemically active surface area and does not require extra fitted parameters. The model also accounts for variation in conductivity of the porous electrodes caused by compositional changes. The model, for the first time, predicts discharge-coup-de-fouet phenomenon and its features using non-nucleation mechanism. It attempts to resolve long-standing ambiguity over origin of the phenomenon by providing alternative explanation for it based on availability of the active surface area. The model also provides different interpretation for limited capacity utilization of the active mass during the discharge cycle. Finally, based on the model predictions, controlling mechanisms for different regions of the battery discharge characteristics are identified. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have gained immense popularity since their commercial release in 2022, with applications in various sectors including health care. We sought to evaluate their deployment in anesthesiology and critical care in a systematic review. Our aim was to describe the integration of LLMs in the field by showcasing and categorizing their current applications, assessing their performance in patient care, and reviewing application-specific ethical and practical challenges in deployment. Methods: Respecting Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically searched through PubMed®, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science®, from inception until 1 August 2024. We extracted all papers investigating LLMs in anesthesiology or critical care and reporting results. We segmented the literature into major themes and highlighted key findings and limitations. Results: From 480 retrieved articles, we included 45 papers. The evaluated models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Google Bard [now Gemini], LLaMA, and others) showed diverse applications in four segments: intensive care unit, patient education, medical education, and perioperative care. Large language models, especially newer models, are promising in predicting clinical scores, navigating simple clinical scenarios, and managing preoperative anxiety. Their performance remains below the clinician level in predicting outcomes, solving complex clinical scenarios (i.e., airway management), board examinations, and generating patient-directed documents, although newer models performed better than older ones. Conclusion: While LLMs are not yet equipped to fully assist physicians in anesthesiology and critical care, they have significant potential, and their capabilities are rapidly improving. Supervised use for select tasks can streamline patient care. Further trials are warranted as new versions of models become available.

	abstract = {Studying the spatial variation patterns and influencing factors of soil organic matter (SOM) in hilly and basin areas is of great significance for guiding agricultural production practices. This study takes Lanxi City as an example and comprehensively considers soil formation factors such as climate, vegetation, and terrain. Based on the genetic algorithm, 47 environmental variables are combined and optimized to construct a random forest (RF) model and an improved version—a random forest model based on genetic algorithm variable combination optimization (RF-GA). At the same time, the SHAP interpretation method is used to quantitatively analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOM content and further identify the main driving factors. Compared with the ordinary Kriging (OK) and random forest (RF) methods, the random forest model based on genetic algorithm variable combination optimization (RF-GA) demonstrates a significantly improved prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.49; RMSE = 3.49 g·kg−1), with an MAE = 3.019 and LCCC = 0.67. Among the three models, the R2 of the RF-GA model increases by 87.84% and 56.29%. The model prediction results indicate that the SOM content in the study area ranges from 12.11 to 31.38 g·kg−1, showing spatial distribution characteristics of a higher content in mountainous areas and a lower content in plains. A further SHAP analysis shows that terrain, climate, and biological factors are key environmental factors affecting the spatial differentiation of the SOM, with the channel network base level (CNBL), which contributes 20.68% to the model, and DEM, which has a contribution rate of 5.57%, playing particularly significant roles. By regulating moisture, erosion deposition, vegetation distribution, and microclimate conditions, they significantly affect the spatial distribution of the SOM. In summary, the RF-GA and its interpretable prediction model constructed in this study not only effectively reveal the spatial and driving mechanisms of SOM in hilly and basin areas but also provide a solid theoretical basis and practical guidance for accurate mapping, the formulation of sustainable utilization strategies for soil resources, and ensuring national food security. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for laser cladding applications, sparking considerable interest in their design. Phase prediction of HEA coatings presents a formidable challenge due to the non-equilibrium solidification characteristics inherent in laser cladding and the intricate influence of substrate variables. This study employs machine learning (ML), leveraging a dataset of 513 HEAs, to explore phase formation and stability in coatings. The dilution rate and carbon equivalent are introduced as input features that encapsulate the processing nuances of laser cladding. Simulated annealing algorithm and over-sampling method are used to optimize the ML model. The predicted outcomes for 10 unexplored HEA phases closely align with experimental results from laser cladding experiments. Utilizing the SHAP (Shapley Additional Explanations) model, the importance of input features is elucidated, identifying valence electron concentration (VEC) as the most influential. Data analysis further probes the solid solution formation capability of HEA coatings, establishing the following criteria: for single BCC phase, VEC is less than 7.4 and δ is less than 7.63; for single FCC phase, VEC is greater than 7.5 and δ is less than 7.46; and for dual-phase BCC + FCC structure, VEC ranges from 7.2 to 7.8 and δ spans 2.5 to 8.24. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Medical information extraction (IE) is an essential aspect of electronic health records (EHRs), but it is a challenging task that converts plain text into structured knowledge, where domain models struggle to achieve performance. Recently, large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, have emerged as a promising method for handling natural language texts. However, LLMs are too dependent on elaborate prompts, resulting in extensive expert knowledge and manual prompt templates needed. In this work, we propose a novel method for the automatic prompt design, called Particle Swarm Optimization-based Prompt using a Large language model (PSOPL). As an efficient method for medical information extraction from EHRs, PSOPL can allow particle swarm optimization (PSO) to automate design prompts by leveraging LLM's ability to generate coherent text token-by-token. Specifically, starting with a small number of initial prompts, evolutionary operators in PSOPL guide the LLM to generate new candidate prompts iteratively, and the PSOPL evaluates population fitness to retain the optimal prompts. In this way, PSOPL can achieve prompt evolution without model training and reduce the human effort and requirement for domain knowledge. We conducted experiments for open-source LLMs (e.g., Alpaca-7B, GPT-J-6B) and closed-source LLM (e.g., GLM-4), on public medical datasets (e.g., CMeEE, CMeIE, CHIP-CDEE) covering information extraction tasks (e.g., named Entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction) to verify the method's generalizability. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of using PSO-based LLMs to design prompts automatically, allowing for the swift extraction of important information about patients in the EHRs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether the level of the inferior mesenteric artery ligation affects the incidence of anastomotic leakage remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the level of inferior mesenteric artery ligation on blood flow to the anastomotic site and the incidence of anastomotic leakage using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of the EssentiAL trial. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at 41 tertiary referral centers in Japan. PATIENTS: A total of 839 patients with rectal cancer (<12 cm from the anal verge) were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of anastomotic leakage and perfusion status were compared between the high and low ligation groups. RESULTS: The median fluorescence time was similar at 25 seconds in both groups (p = 0.74). Although no statistical difference was noted, the high ligation group was more likely to have greater outliers in fluorescence time compared to the low ligation group. The high ligation group demonstrated higher poor perfusion rates than the low ligation group (2.8% vs 1.5%). In the high ligation group, anastomotic leakage occurred in 1 case of poor perfusion where additional resection was not performed by the surgeon’s intraoperative judgment. In addition, the additional resection rate nearly doubled with the use of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. After propensity score matching (129 patients per group), the overall anastomotic leakage rate was 13.2% in the high ligation group and 10.9% in the low ligation group (p = 0.57). LIMITATIONS: This study was a post hoc analysis, the sample size was small, and the anastomosis methods varied. CONCLUSIONS: The level of inferior mesenteric artery ligation did not affect blood flow at the anastomotic site or the incidence of anastomotic leakage statistically, but assessing bowel perfusion using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging can offer clinical benefits, optimizing patient outcomes.

	abstract = {Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous and widely implemented. LLMs could also be used for diagnosis and treatment. National antibiotic prescribing guidelines are customized and informed by local laboratory data on antimicrobial resistance. Methods: Based on 24 vignettes with information on type of infection, gender, age group and comorbidities, GPs and LLMs were prompted to provide a treatment. Four countries (Ireland, UK, USA and Norway) were included and a GP from each country and six LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Mistral AI, Claude and Llama 3.1) were provided with the vignettes, including their location (country). Responses were compared with the country’s national prescribing guidelines. In addition, limitations of LLMs such as hallucination, toxicity and data leakage were assessed. Results: GPs’ answers to the vignettes showed high accuracy in relation to diagnosis (96%–100%) and yes/no antibiotic prescribing (83%–92%). GPs referenced (100%) and prescribed (58%–92%) according to national guidelines, but dose/duration of treatment was less accurate (50%–75%). Overall, the GPs’ accuracy had a mean of 74%. LLMs scored high in relation to diagnosis (92%–100%), antibiotic prescribing (88%–100%) and the choice of antibiotic (59%–100%) but correct referencing often failed (38%–96%), in particular for the Norwegian guidelines (0%–13%). Data leakage was shown to be an issue as personal information was repeated in the models’ responses to the vignettes. Conclusions: LLMs may be safe to guide antibiotic prescribing in general practice.

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages LLMs as pattern recognition tools to improve MHs. The resulting hybrid method, tested in the context of a social network-based combinatorial optimization problem, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with MHs regarding the obtained solution quality. By carefully designing prompts, we demonstrate that the output obtained from LLMs can be used as problem knowledge, leading to improved results.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three large language models (LLMs), GPT-4o, Llama 3.3 70B and Llama 3.1 8B, in redacting personally identifying information (PII) from forum data in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Design/methodology/approach: Forum posts from students enrolled in nine MOOCs were redacted by three human reviewers. The GPT and Llama models were then tasked with de-identifying the same data set using standardized prompts. Discrepancies between LLM and human redactions were analyzed to identify patterns in LLM errors. Findings: All models achieved an average recall of over 0.9 in identifying PII and identified PII instances overlooked by humans. However, their precisions were lower – 0.579 for GPT-4o, 0.506 for Llama 3.3 and 0.262 for Llama 3.1 – showing a tendency to over-redact non-PII names and locations. Research limitations/implications: Several courses’ data were analyzed to increase findings’ generalizability but the models’ performance may vary in other contexts. GPT and Llama models were selected because of their availability and cost-effectiveness at the time of the study; future newer models may improve performance. Practical implications: The use of downloadable LLMs enables researchers to de-identify data without training specialized models or involving external companies, ensuring that student data remains private. Originality/value: Previous research on LLM text de-identification has largely used proprietary models, which require sharing data containing sensitive PII with third-party companies. This study evaluates the performance of two open weight models that can be deployed locally, eliminating the need to share sensitive data externally. © 2025, Andres Felipe Zambrano, Shreya Singhal, Maciej Pankiewicz, Ryan Shaun Baker, Chelsea Porter and Xiner Liu.},

	abstract = {The double facade solar chimney along with energy storage components is a sustainable building technology that harnesses the power of the sun to regulate indoor temperatures. Extensive research has been conducted on the theoretical simulation of such systems. The novelty of this work is to explore the potential of explainable artificial intelligence in improving the design and optimization of the double-skin solar chimney. The need for this research is owing to the high computational limitations of the physical model of such systems, thus the application of explainable artificial intelligence based upon artificial neural network can address this research gap. The paper solved a validated physical model and demonstrates the suitability of artificial neural network twins as computational-efficient subrogates that can be later used by a multiobjective optimization function to find the optimal design values for the facades of double-skin buildings. The results of the comparison between the physical and the artificial neural network model show the practical advantage of utilizing the digital twin model without compromising accuracy. The results have indicated that the artificial neural network can achieve a high coefficient of determination ranging from 0.921 to 0.999 on different performance indicators that implies a high goodness of fit. Accordingly, the optimization study based upon a nonsorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has indicated a high ventilation rate of 2.86 1/h and an efficiency of 37.21%. The insights of this work have reflected that exploring the societal implications of sustainable building technologies such as the double facade solar chimney through educational initiatives can cultivate a new generation of society who not only understand the technical aspects but also appreciate the broader social and environmental contexts of their work, eventually to have future buildings with integrated passive systems. © The Author(s) 2025.

	abstract = {Food adulteration involves the practice of adding or mixing inferior substances to food products, which undermines quality and safety. Adulteration of red chilli with brick powder is a significant food safety issue as it poses serious health risks to consumers. Accurate identification of the adulteration presents a significant challenge, particularly when adulteration is present in minuscule amounts. Existing methods aimed at identifying such micro levels of food adulteration are less accurate and lack interpretability. This study aims to address the research gaps in food adulteration by developing a robust model that integrates machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence methods. The key contributions of the proposed work are a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to enhance the model performance in limited data scenarios; improved particle swarm optimization as a promising metaheuristic optimization method to select the robust and highly discriminative features and to address premature convergence; explainable artificial intelligence methods (SHAP and LIME) to enhance the ensemble stacking model transparency and interpretability. A custom dataset is generated in the work, and it comprises 250 natural samples distributed among 5 categories (50 samples per category), ranging from no adulteration to adulteration in varying concentrations of 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 4 %, respectively. The proposed work is implemented on the synthetic data (200 samples per category) generated by the deep convolutional generative adversarial network. The potent combination of improved particle swarm optimization and explainable artificial intelligence enhances the accuracy, interpretability, and transparency of the proposed model by providing deeper insights which in turn bolsters confidence in distinguishing between pure and adulterated red chilli powder samples, thus contributing to improved food safety measures. The proposed model has shown a remarkable accuracy of 92.42 % on the synthetic data. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

However, these models often lack interpretability and transparency, which hinders their accessibility for both researchers and practitioners. In response to this challenge, this study explores the utilization of Genetic Programming (GP) to bridge the existing research gap between high predictive accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models. Unlike black-box models, GP allows for the development of simplified closed-form liquefaction prediction models that provide clear insights into the underlying relationships between soil properties and liquefaction potential. By automatically generating and evolving mathematical expressions, GP offers a transparent and interpretable approach that enhances the understanding of the factors influencing liquefaction. This study validates the proposed GP model against existing models in the literature to ascertain its effectiveness and reliability. The results demonstrate that the GP model achieves comparable accuracy to traditional black-box models, while significantly enhancing interpretability. The findings highlight the potential of GP as a valuable tool for developing interpretable and reliable models for soil liquefaction prediction, offering a promising alternative to traditional black-box models. © ASCE.},

	abstract = {Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is an important and challenging problem in machine learning. Traditional HPO methods require substantial evaluations to search for superior configurations. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches leverage domain knowledge and few-shot learning proficiency to discover promising configurations with minimal human effort. However, the repetition issues causes LLMs to generate configurations similar to context examples, which may confine the optimization process to local regions. Moreover, since LLMs rely on the examples they generate for a few-shot learning, a self-reinforcing loop is formed, hindering LLMs from escaping local optima. In this work, we propose EvoContext, which aims to intentionally generate configurations that differ significantly from examples via external interventions and actively breaks the self-reinforcing effect for a more efficient approximation of the global optimum. Our EvoContext method involves two phases: (i) initial example generation through cold or warm starting and (ii) iterative optimization that integrates genetic operations for updating examples to enhance global exploration capabilities. Additionally, it employs LLMs in-context learning to generate configurations based on competitive examples for local refinement. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that EvoContext outperforms traditional and other LLM-driven approaches on HPO. © 2025 by the authors.},

Additionally, an uncertainty quantification approach was utilized to assess the reliability of susceptibility maps. The landslide susceptibility map was prepared using 153 landslide occurrence points and 15 effective criteria on landslides in Khalkhal town of Iran.

	abstract = {Process parameters are critical in determining the quality and performance of laser deep penetration welding (LDPW) by influencing key factors like breakpoint tensile strength (BTS). Optimizing these parameters is essential for ensuring consistent weld quality and improving overall efficiency. As the dimensionality of process parameters and sample sizes increase, the relationship between process parameters and BTS becomes increasingly complex, uncertain, and nonlinear. While machine learning (ML) techniques struggle to handle this complexity, deep learning (DL) methods, although effective at capturing nonlinear patterns, are constrained by their lack of interpretability, limiting their wider application in industrial environments. To address these challenges, an intrinsically and post-hoc interpretable approach combining the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. An LDPW experimental platform is first established, employing an orthogonal design (L81) with five factors at three levels to gather datasets. A lightweight and interpretable KAN with a single hidden layer is then developed to establish the nonlinear relationship between process parameters and BTS. During optimization, the trained KAN serves as a surrogate model to define decision variables, constraints, and objective functions, with interpretability enhanced through graphical and symbolic representations that clarify how process parameters impact the BTS. Furthermore, the post-hoc Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is employed to provide global and local insight into the overall and sample-specific influence on BTS. Validation of the optimization results confirms that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {How are species selected for de-extinction? The implications of de-extinction for restoration ecology greatly depend on the type of species that is resurrected. Several guidelines have been developed that propose selection criteria based on their positive ecological impact. Little is known, however, about how people actually make the choice for a particular species, and whether those guidelines are followed in practice. We systematically investigated what motives play a role in selecting candidate species for de-extinction through the analysis of 18 interviews and 128 online sources on selection processes for ongoing de-extinction projects worldwide. We found that candidate species for de-extinction are selected for a variety of reasons, including non-ecological reasons like animal charisma and personal fascination. We analyse these results using a relational framework from the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) that explains priority setting in research by looking at the relations between researchers with funders, users, and public values. We demonstrate that in the case of de-extinction, these relations create an environment in which charismatic species are structurally favoured, possibly at the expense of more ecologically sound species. This complements approaches in evolutionary psychology that explain the endurance of animal charisma by focusing on emotional responses in individuals who are triggered by animals with a ‘cuddle factor’. We argue that even if individuals are able to overcome such emotional triggers, animal charisma as selection criteria will endure because the relations between different actors structurally favour the selection of charismatic species. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Normal quality of life is an ultimate target in the therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the context of which regular physical activity (PA) is often a chimeric parameter that is not standardized in terms of quality/quantity. The study aimed to profile a sample of IBD patients about the relationship between PA-partner status and social network support. Patients and methods: A post hoc analysis of the “BE-FIT-IBD” study was set up by stratifying the data of PA with that of partner status and the support that the patient's social network (i.e., relatives, friends) provided in inciting the patient to practice regular PA. Results: In the 219 patients included, there was a greater tendency for patients with stable partners to view the risk of reactivation/worsening of IBD as a barrier to conducting regular PA (p < 0.0001). Single patients considered PA more as a protective factor (p = 0.045). Patients without a PA-supporting social network retained IBD-related treatment as a PA barrier (p = 0.016) and PA as a risk for IBD complications (p = 0.01), with less confidence that PA could improve the course of IBD (p < 0.001). Rectal syndrome was an IBD-related barrier more represented in patients with PA-deterring social network (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: These factors are potential targets for recovering the IBD patient's adherence to regular PA. © 2024 Elsevier España, S.L.U.},

	abstract = {In text classifier models, the complexity of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is very high because of the vast state space and uncertainty of transitions, which makes the RNN classifier’s explainability insufficient. It is almost impossible to explain the large-scale RNN directly. A feasible method is to generalize the rules undermining it, that is, model abstraction. To deal with the low efficiency and excessive information loss in existing model abstraction for RNNs, this work proposes a PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-based model abstraction and explanation generation method for RNNs. Firstly, the k-means clustering is applied to preliminarily partition the RNN decision process state. Secondly, a frequency prefix tree is constructed based on the traces, and a PSO algorithm is designed to implement state merging to address the problem of vast state space. Then, a PFA (probabilistic finite automata) is constructed to explain the RNN structure with preserving the origin RNN information as much as possible. Finally, the quantitative keywords are labeled as an explanation for classification results, which are automatically generated with the abstract model PFA. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in some cases. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Engineering inspection is of great significance to ensure the safe operation of the project. However, the unclear query statements of the detectors pose a challenge to the intelligent question answering task. Existing knowledge graph-based question-answering systems face issues of vocabulary limitations and reliance on fixed templates. Solely relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) for questioning introduces noise and randomness due to their extensive knowledge base. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach that synergistically employs both knowledge graphs and LLMs for intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection. The method divides the overall task into five units, progressively clarifying query statements for accurate answers. Leveraging LLM’s vast prior knowledge, robust semantic understanding, and contextual learning mitigates issues related to vocabulary limitations and template dependence. Simultaneously, the knowledge contained in the graph is integrated into an optimal clarification path and transferred to LLM to address noise and randomness, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the clarification process. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision, and Recall metrics all above 0.73. The results affirm the method’s effectiveness in improving the accuracy of intelligent question-answering in hydroengineering inspection, with potential implications for similar applications in other domains of hydraulic engineering. © 2024 The Author(s).

Specifically, the basic ZSO algorithm involves two search operators: the prey-predator interaction operator and the social flocking operator to balance exploration and exploitation well. Furthermore, we designed four variants of the ZSO algorithm with slight human-interacted adjustment. In numerical experiments, we comprehensively investigate the performance of ZSO-derived algorithms on CEC2014 benchmark functions, CEC2022 benchmark functions, and six engineering optimization problems. 20 popular and state-of-the-art MAs are employed as competitors.

In fact, the values of the hyperparameters directly impact the trajectory taken by the optimization process, and their choice requires extensive reasoning by human operators. Although a variety of self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms have been proposed in the literature, no definitive solution has been found. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation to automate the reasoning process that leads to the choice of hyperparameter values. We employ two open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), namely Llama2-70b and Mixtral, to analyze the optimization logs online and provide novel real-time hyperparameter recommendations.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight convolutional neural network model called Gated Asymmetrical GhostNet (GA-GhostNet), specifically designed for the automatic identification of plant diseases and pests. The model incorporates a Gated Multi-scale Coordinate Attention (GM-CA) module to filter out noise and irrelevant information in the image, while capturing location information of diseases and pests at different scales. The model also utilizes an improved feature extraction module called Asymmetrical Ghost (AG) module to enhance robustness to image flipping, as well as improve feature extraction capabil-ities. Additionally, the CutMix data augmentation method is employed to improve generalization ability. In extensive experimental evaluations on the IP102 pest dataset, GA-GhostNet achieved impressive results with 63.73% MRec, 67.37% MPre, 65.12% MF1, and 71.90% Acc. Moreover, through transfer learning on the Jute pest, Embrapa disease, and Apple disease datasets, the model outperforms numerous lightweight models, attaining accuracies of 99.89%, 96.97%, and 95.17%, respec-tively, while having only 3.73 million parameters.

	abstract = {The resilient modulus (MR) of pavement subgrade soils is an index describing the structural response of flexible pavement foundations. Commonly, MR under different conditions of confining pressures and deviatoric stresses are tested by cyclic triaxial compressive experiments. However, such experiments are elaborate, expensive, and time-consuming, so developing more flexible and efficient approaches is imperative. This study investigates the potential application of a tree-based model termed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) on predicting MR. First, a dataset containing 891 samples of repeated load triaxial tests and the characteristics of subgrade soil is collected. Then, an XGBoost model, combined with a feature selection technique (Exhaustive Feature Selector (EFS)) and an optimization algorithm (Jellyfish Swarm Optimizer (JSO)), is trained on the collected dataset. EFS is used to identify the most suitable combinations of factors for MR prediction and JSO is applied to determine the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model, which aim to establish a robust XGBoost model with the best predictive capacity. Lastly, this study employs two advanced model interpretation techniques to identify the predominant factors affecting MR prediction based on the established XGBoost model. The results indicated that the EFS approach can effectively ascertain the best combination of factors for MR prediction; the JSO algorithm can effectively capture the optimal hyper-parameters of the XGBoost model; the resultant XGBoost model achieved a favorable capacity for MR prediction. Moreover, three primary factors affecting MR prediction are unveiled, which are the degree of soil saturation (Sr), confining stress (σ3), and plasticity index (PI). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EVOPROMPT, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EVOPROMPT starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EVOPROMPT significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EVOPROMPT demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.

	abstract = {A series of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed to handle expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs). However, the surrogate of these SAEAs is underutilized to a large extent, which limits the search efficiency of these algorithms. To be specific, existing algorithms do not sufficiently exploit the estimated solution quality information from the surrogate models during offspring generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an SAEA framework named EXO-SAEA (EXplanation Operator based Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm). First, it divides the current population into two populations according to the a priori knowledge from the surrogate model. Then, for each solution in the first population, EXO-SAEA employs the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to estimate the contribution of each decision variable to the fitness values. After that, the Shapley values are then normalized for the offspring generation of the first population, while the second population uses generic GA operators. Two representative surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are used to instantiate the proposed framework. Experimental results on the synthetic benchmark problems and three real-world problems involving six state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Identifying flood drivers and accurately estimating design floods play a crucial role in fostering sustainable and effective planning and management strategies for mitigating flood risks. Regional Flood frequency Analysis (RFFA) is one of the most commonly used approaches to estimate design floods in ungauged watersheds. This study used XGBoost coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to estimate different quantiles of the design floods with return periods (from 2-year to 1000-year). After a preliminary assessment, 373 nationwide hydrometric stations were selected to conduct at-site flood frequency analysis by identifying the best-fitting distribution. Using the capabilities of GIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE), 83 independent features including different physiographical, geomorphological, land-use, soil types, and long-term hydro-climatic and environmental variables were extracted for the upstream watersheds. After fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of the XGBoost method for each flood quantile, the feature importance values were used to eliminate the insignificant features and refine the developed models. Additionally, classical methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) were implemented, to evaluate the XGBoost models efficiency. Different statistics demonstrated that the models effectively estimated flood quantiles, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) varying from 0.709 to 0.840 across all models. A comparison of model performance reveals that the XGBoost method outperformed RF and SVR across all flood quantiles. Based on the developed models, design floods have been estimated for 949 stations across Iran. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were used to identify the main contributing features to model outputs and investigate the spatial heterogeneity of main flood drivers. According to the results, the perimeter and length of the watershed and heavy rainfall exhibit notably high importance compared to other features for all models. Based on the local SHAP values, in Northern, Northwestern, and Western basins, features associated with watershed sizes, such as perimeter, area and length exhibit the highest levels of importance. Moreover, the Southwest basins are more influenced by “heavy rainfall”. These findings demonstrate the promise of the developed models for estimating flood quantiles across diverse environmental, geomorphological, and hydro-climatic conditions. This capability is valuable for sustainable watershed management, especially in environments with limited maximum discharge data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

We introduce a novel optimization strategy that prioritizes computational efficiency and ecological impact alongside traditional performance metrics leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Our analysis reveals that while the pipelines we developed did not surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) models regarding raw performance, they offer a significantly reduced carbon footprint. We discovered SML optimal pipelines with competitive performance and up to 70 times less carbon emissions than hybrid or fully LLM pipelines, such as standard BERT and DistilBERT variants. Similarly, we obtain hybrid pipelines (using SML and LLMs) with between 20% and 50% reduced carbon emissions compared to fine-tuned alternatives and only a marginal decrease in performance. This research challenges the prevailing reliance on computationally intensive LLMs for NLP tasks and underscores the untapped potential of AutoML in sculpting the next wave of environmentally conscious AI models. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.},

Instead, the evaluation of the knowledge that these models have of the languages has received much less attention. For example, the words that they can recognize and use in different languages. In this paper, we evaluate the knowledge that open chat LLMs have of Spanish words by testing a sample of words in a reference dictionary. The results show that open chat LLMs produce incorrect meanings for an important fraction of the words and are not able to use most of the words correctly to write sentences with context. These results show how Spanish is left behind in the LLM race and highlight the need to push for linguistic fairness in conversational LLMs ensuring that they provide similar performance across languages. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.},

	abstract = {Counterfactual inference for continuous rather than binary treatment variables is more common in real-world causal inference tasks. While there are already some sample reweighting methods based on Marginal Structural Model for eliminating the confounding bias, they generally focus on removing the treatment’s linear dependence on confounders and rely on the accuracy of the assumed parametric models, which are usually unverifiable. In this paper, we propose a de-confounding representation learning (DRL) framework for counterfactual outcome estimation of continuous treatment by generating the representations of covariates decorrelated with the treatment variables. The DRL is a non-parametric model that eliminates both linear and nonlinear dependence between treatment and covariates. Specifically, we train the correlations between the de-confounding representations and the treatment variables against the correlations between the covariate representations and the treatment variables to eliminate confounding bias. Further, a counterfactual inference network is embedded into the framework to make the learned representations serve both de-confounding and trusted inference. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that the DRL model performs superiorly in learning de-confounding representations and outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual inference models for continuous treatment variables. In addition, we apply the DRL model to a real-world medical dataset MIMIC III and demonstrate a detailed causal relationship between red cell width distribution and mortality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Paragangliomas are rare, primarily slow-growing tumors for which the underlying growth pattern is unknown. Therefore, determining the best care for a patient is hard. Currently, if no significant tumor growth is observed, treatment is often delayed, as treatment itself is not without risk. However, by doing so, the risk of (irreversible) adverse effects due to tumor growth may increase. Being able to predict the growth accurately could assist in determining whether a patient will need treatment during their lifetime and, if so, the timing of this treatment. The aim of this work is to learn the general underlying growth pattern of paragangliomas from multiple tumor growth data sets, in which each data set contains a tumor's volume over time. To do so, we propose a novel approach based on genetic programming to learn a function class, i.e., a parameterized function that can be fit anew for each tumor. We do so in a unique, multi-modal, multi-objective fashion to find multiple potentially interesting function classes in a single run. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic and a real-world data set. By analyzing the resulting function classes, we can effectively explain the general patterns in the data. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {In our previous article (Letsios 2023 J. High Energy Phys. JHEP05(2023)015), we showed that the strictly massless spin-3/2 field, as well as the strictly and partially massless spin-5/2 fields, on N-dimensional ( N ⩾ 3 ) de Sitter (dS) spacetime (dS N ) are non-unitary unless N = 4. The (non-)unitarity was demonstrated by simply observing that there is a (mis-)match between the representation-theoretic labels that correspond to the unitary irreducible representations (UIR’s) of the dS algebra spin ( N , 1 ) and the ones corresponding to the space of eigenmodes of the field theories. In this paper, we provide a technical representation-theoretic explanation for this fact by studying the (non-)existence of positive-definite, dS invariant scalar products for the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 strictly/partially massless eigenmodes on dS N  ( N ⩾ 3 ). Our basic tool is the examination of the action of spin ( N , 1 ) generators on the space of eigenmodes, leading to the following findings. For odd N, any dS invariant scalar product is identically zero. For even N > 4, any dS invariant scalar product must be indefinite. This gives rise to positive-norm and negative-norm eigenmodes that mix with each other under spin ( N , 1 ) boosts. In the N = 4 case, the positive-norm sector decouples from the negative-norm sector and each sector separately forms a UIR of spin(4, 1). Our analysis makes extensive use of the analytic continuation of tensor-spinor spherical harmonics on the N-sphere (SN) to dSN and also introduces representation-theoretic techniques that are absent from the mathematical physics literature on half-odd-integer-spin fields on dS N  © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease has caused severe threats to the daily life and health of people all over the world. Hence, early detection and timely treatment of this disease are significant to prevent the coronavirus's spread and ensure more effective patient care. This work adopted an integrated framework comprising deep learning and attention mechanism to provide a more effective and reliable diagnosis. This framework consists of two convolution neural network (CNN), a bidirectional LSTM, two fully-connected layers (FCL), and an attention mechanism. The main aim of the proposed framework is to reveal a promising approach based on deep learning for early and timely detection of coronavirus disease. For greater accuracy, the framework's hyperparameters are tuned by means of a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been examined utilizing a public dataset including 18 different blood findings from Albert Einstein Israelita Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Additionally, within the experimental studies, the proposed framework is subjected to comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, evaluated across various metrics. Based on the derived consequences, the proposed framework has yielded enhancements in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, registering approximate improvements of 1.27%, 4.07%, 3.20%, and 2.88%, respectively, as measured against the second-best rates. © The Author(s) 2024.},

To address this urgent need, we present AVP-GPT2, a deep-learning model that significantly outperforms its predecessor, AVP-GPT, in designing and screening antiviral peptides. Trained on a significantly expanded dataset, AVP-GPT2 employs a transformer-based architecture to generate diverse peptide sequences. A multi-modal screening approach, incorporating Star-Transformer and Vision Transformer, enables accurate prediction of antiviral activity and toxicity, leading to the identification of potent and safe candidates. SHAP analysis further enhances interpretability by explaining the underlying mechanisms of peptide activity. Our in vitro experiments confirmed the antiviral efficacy of peptides generated by AVP-GPT2, with some exhibiting EC50 values as low as 0.01 μM and CC50 values > 30 μM. This represents a substantial improvement over AVP-GPT and traditional methods. AVP-GPT2 has the potential to significantly impact antiviral drug discovery by accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic agents.

	abstract = {Interpretability is a critical aspect to ensure a fair and responsible use of machine learning (ML) in high-stakes applications. Genetic programming (GP) has been used to obtain interpretable ML models because it operates at the level of functional building blocks: if these building blocks are interpretable, there is a chance that their composition (i.e., the entire ML model) is also interpretable. However, the degree to which a model is interpretable depends on the observer. Motivated by this, we study a recently-introduced human-in-The-loop system that allows the user to steer GP's generation process to their preferences, which shall be online-learned by an artificial neural network (ANN). We focus on the generation of ML models as analytical functions (i.e., symbolic regression) as this is a key problem in interpretable ML, and propose a two-fold contribution. First, we devise more general representations for the ML models for the ANN to learn upon, to enable the application of the system to a wider range of problems. Second, we delve into a deeper analysis of the system's components. To this end, we propose an incremental experimental evaluation, aimed at (1) studying the effectiveness by which an ANN can capture the perceived interpretability for simulated users, (2) investigating how the GP's outcome is affected across different simulated user feedback profiles, and (3) determining whether humans participants would prefer models that were generated with or without their involvement. Our results pose clarity on pros and cons of using a human-in-The-loop approach to discover interpretable ML models with GP. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, lack of interpretability, and ethical concerns persist. This study addresses these gaps by developing an interpretable AI model to predict snack choices in a controlled laboratory experiment. Method: a random forest classifier was trained to predict participants’ snack choices (healthy vs. unhealthy) based on contextual factors (hunger, mood, time of day) and historical choices. Data were collected from 75 adults over 10 sessions, with features engineered to capture both immediate and longitudinal patterns. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance analysis. Results: the model achieved 85,33 % accuracy, with hunger level, historical choices, and mood identified as the most influential predictors. Performance improved over sessions (peaking at 93,33 % accuracy in sessions 8–9), highlighting the value of longitudinal data. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across age, gender, and BMI, with higher accuracy for participants with healthier habits and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: this study demonstrates the feasibility of interpretable AI models in predicting dietary behavior while addressing ethical concerns through rigorous data anonymization and informed consent protocols. The findings underscore the potential of AI to inform personalized interventions for healthier eating habits and provide a framework for ethical AI implementation in behavioral research. © 2025; Los autores.},

This problem becomes even more pronounced in dynamic environments such as cloud systems. This paper proposes an interpretable rule-based solution to minimize this problem. Combining metaheuristic task scheduling solutions and machine learning techniques, this method uses a two-phase mechanism, semi-offline and online. In the semi-offline phase, we first archive metaheuristic solutions to previously randomly generated or encountered task-scheduling problems. The basic idea of the proposed method is to reuse these previously obtained successful metaheuristic solution patterns for future similar problems. Finding similar solution patterns from this extensive archive dataset is done by automatically extracting rule sets through machine learning techniques. These interpretable rule sets are used to identify the type of task scheduling problem encountered in the online phase and to find the optimal solution pattern. The performance of this method, which dramatically reduces execution time and enables the use of metaheuristics in time-critical applications, has been tested and proven for various cloud task-scheduling scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The existence of antibiotics in water sources poses substantial hazards to both the environment and public health. To effectively monitor and combat this problem, accurate predictive models are essential. This research focused on employing machine learning (ML) techniques to construct some models for analyzing the adsorption capacity of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic from contaminated water. The robustness of ten machine learning algorithms was evaluated using performance metrics such as the Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Square Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The hyperparameters of the ML models were fine-tuned using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The optimized models were comprehensively evaluated using feature importance analysis to quantify the relative significance of operational variables accurately. After a thorough assessment and comparison of various machine learning models, it was evident that the HistGradientBoosting (HGB) model outperformed others in terms of CIP adsorption performance. This was supported by their low MAE value of 0.1865 and high R2 value of 0.9999. The modeling projected the highest antibiotic adsorption (99.28%) under optimized conditions, including 10 mg/L of CIP, 357 mg/L of CuWO4@TiO2 adsorbent, a contact time of 60 min at room temperature, and near neutral pH (7.5). The combination of advanced ML algorithms and nano adsorbents has great potential for addressing the problem of antibiotic pollution in water sources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In developing a theory of consciousness, one of the main problems has to do with determining what distinguishes conscious states from non-conscious ones—the delimitation problem. This paper explores the possibility of solving this problem in terms of self-awareness. That self-awareness is essential to understanding the nature of our conscious experience is perhaps the most widely discussed hypothesis in the study of consciousness throughout the history of philosophy. Its plausibility hinges on how the notion of self-awareness is unpacked. The idea that consciousness involves self-awareness has been understood in two different ways: either as awareness of oneself—the subject of experience—or as awareness of the conscious episode itself. In this paper I argue (i) that every experience concerns the subject in a very specific way, involving what I will call ‘perspectival de se representation’, and (ii) that there is no need to appeal to the experience itself in order to characterize the awareness within that experience. The view I articulate explains the subjective nature of experience without over-intellectualizing it, accommodates the phenomenology of experience, and dispels any doubt about the need to find the self in introspection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have made great advances in assisting antibody design. However, antibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a Pre-trained Antibody generative large Language Model (PALM-H3) for the de novo generation of artificial antibodies heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) with desired antigen-binding specificity, reducing the reliance on natural antibodies. We also build a high-precision model antigen-antibody binder (A2binder) that pairs antigen epitope sequences with antibody sequences to predict binding specificity and affinity. PALM-H3-generated antibodies exhibit binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the emerging XBB variant, as confirmed through in-silico analysis and in-vitro assays. The in-vitro assays validate that PALM-H3-generated antibodies achieve high binding affinity and potent neutralization capability against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and the emerging XBB variant. Meanwhile, A2binder demonstrates exceptional predictive performance on binding specificity for various epitopes and variants. Furthermore, by incorporating the attention mechanism inherent in the Roformer architecture into the PALM-H3 model, we improve its interpretability, providing crucial insights into the fundamental principles of antibody design. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent times, various algorithms have been developed to assist in the selection of embryos for transfer based on artificial intelligence (AI). Nevertheless, the majority of AI models employed in this context were characterized by a lack of transparency. To address these concerns, we aim to design an interpretable tool to automate human embryo evaluation by combining artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 223 human blastocyst time-lapse (TL) images taken at 110 hours post-injection. All the images were evaluated by five embryologists from different clinics in terms of blastocyst expansion (BE), quality of the inner cell mass (ICM), and trophectoderm (TE). The embryo database was used to develop an AI system (70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test) for automate blastocyst assessment. The entire set of images underwent a standardization process, followed by processing and segmentation using Matlab software. The resulting quantified variables were utilized in AI techniques (ANN and GA). Finally, the accuracy and performance of the automation tool was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Then, the level of agreement among embryologists and between embryologists and the AI system was compared with Kappa Index. Results: The overall agreement among embryologists was low (Kappa: 0.4 for BE; and 0.3 for TE and ICM). The AI tool achieved higher consistency (Kappa 0.7 for BE and ICM; and 0.4 for TE). The AI exhibited high accuracy in classifying BE (test 81.5%), ICM (test 78.8%), and TE (test 78.3%) and better performance for BE (AUC 0.888-0.956) than for ICM (AUC 0.605-0.854) and TE (AUC 0.726-0.769) assessment. Conclusion: Our AI tool highlighted the superior consistency of AI compared to human operators in grading blastocyst morphology.

These CtB-LLMs are democratizing access to trainable Very Large-Language Models (VLLMs) and, thus, may represent the building blocks of many NLP systems solving downstream tasks. Hence, a little or a large bias in CtB-LLMs may cause significant harm. In this paper, we performed a large investigation of the bias of three families of CtB-LLMs, and we showed that debiasing techniques are effective and usable. Indeed, according to current tests, the LLaMA and the OPT families have an important bias in gender, race, religion, and profession. In contrast to the analysis for other LLMs, we discovered that bias depends not on the number of parameters but on the perplexity. Finally, the debiasing of OPT using LoRA reduces bias up to 4.12 points in the normalized stereotype score. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to evaluate potential gender biases on job postings. Originality/value: The management literature still seeks to understand the different social and economic impacts that the introduction of large language models (LLM) has produced. It is now recognized that such models are not neutral; they carry a large portion of the biases and discriminations found in human language. If used as support in writing job descriptions, it can contribute negatively to the preservation of gender inequality among occupations and the perpetuation of the sexual division of labor. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses different LLMs embeddings to evaluate potential gender biases generated in job postings from two major platforms, LinkedIn and Vagas.com. More specifically, it evaluates gender biases and identifies the vectors’ sensitivity within the context of gender inequality analysis. Findings: The degree of consistency between architectures varies significantly as the words contained in job descriptions and the two gender vectors are altered, which means that even pretrained models might not be reliable to understand gender bias. This lack of consistency indicates that the evaluation of gender bias might be different depending on the parameters. Also, a high sensitivity to pronouns was observed, and the difference between genders seems to be greater when we relate the unitary vectors “man” and “woman” with terms related to family. Contribution/implication: The use of LLM for job postings must be carried out with caution, and efforts to mitigate gender biases must take place on the corpus to be modeled before data training occurs. © 2024 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

	abstract = {Event detection (ED) intends to identify events from text and classify them into predefined event types. One of the major issues for ED is the low-resource problem due to inadequate samples. Some studies address the low-resource issue with retrieving knowledge entries directly from knowledge bases while introducing a lot of irrelevant knowledge or failing the lookup. Moreover, recent work has attempted to employ large language models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) that directly access event types in unstructured text under low-resource scenarios. Although LLM-based approaches have obtained promising results, we consider that the full potential of LLMs has not been activated due to insufficient prompt information. Our research proposes a two-stage event detection method that collaborates small language models (SLMs) and LLMs, namely LSLAED. Specifically, we first fine-tune the SLM to generate three types of latent answers: answer-aware examples, structure-aware examples, and corresponding answer candidates. Subsequently, all latent answers will form the prompt and enable the LLM to improve performance through in-context learning. We evaluate the proposed method using precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Experiments on the ACE2005 and ERE-EN datasets have demonstrated that LSLAED achieves significant improvement in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study develops an approach consisting of a stacking model integrated with a multi-objective optimisation algorithm aimed at predicting and optimising the ecological performance of buildings. The integrated model consists of five base models and a meta-model, which significantly improves the prediction performance. Specifically, the R2 value was improved by 9.19% and the error metrics MAE, MSE, MAPE, and CVRMSE were reduced by 69.47%, 79.88%, 67.32%, and 57.02%, respectively, compared to the single prediction model. According to the research on interpretable machine learning, adding the SHAP value gives us a deeper understanding of the impact of each architectural design parameter on the performance. In the multi-objective optimisation part, we used the NSGA-III algorithm to successfully improve the energy efficiency, daylight utilisation and thermal comfort of the building. Specifically, the optimal design solution reduces the energy use intensity by 31.6 kWh/m2, improves the useful daylight index by 39%, and modulated the thermal comfort index, resulting in a decrement of 0.69 °C for the summer season and an enhancement of 0.64 °C for the winter season, respectively. Overall, this study provides building designers and decision makers with a tool to make better design decisions at an early stage to achieve a better combination of energy efficiency, daylight utilisation and thermal comfort optimisation in an integrated manner, providing an important support for achieving sustainable building design. © Tsinghua University Press 2024.},

	abstract = {Steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) has proven to be a practical and effective alternative to traditional concrete. It offers improved post-cracking performance, increased fracture resistance, and efficient stress transfer by incorporating steel fibers into the concrete mix. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used to accurately estimate concrete qualities, thus reducing time and costs. This research focuses on a novel hybrid machine learning model that such as Gaussian process regression with genetic algorithm (GPR-GA), Random Forest with genetic algorithm (RF-GA), and extreme gradient boosting with genetic algorithm (XGB-GA) to predict the compressive strength of SFRC. The proposed hybrid ML models demonstrate superior performance with an R2 value over 0.92 at both the training and testing stages. Specifically, the R2 value was found to be 0.9804 for GPR-GA, 0.9204 for RF-GA, and 0.9706 for XGB-GA. The RMSE values for GPR-GA, RF-GA, and XGB-GA were 8.38, 16.88, and 16.88, respectively. The overall GPR-GA model outperformed compare to the other two hybrid machine learning models, XGB-GA and RF-GA. Additionally, the SHAP method was utilized to assess the influence of input variables on the predicted compressive strength (CS) of SRFC. From the SHAP analysis, it was found that the temperature and diameter input parameters had the highest influence on the predicted CS compared to other input features. The proposed hybrid ML models provide builders and designers with a flexible and effective tool for analyzing characteristics and making accurate forecasts of the compressive strength of SFRC under high temperatures in building applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {The advent of the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by artificial intelligence (AI) as its central component, has resulted in the mechanization of numerous previously labor-intensive activities. The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model. The utilization of explainable AI and motifs has led to the proposal of two novel operators, namely p-crossover and p-mutation. An online application has been deployed at https://neuropred.anvil.app for designing an ideal collection of synthesizable NPs from protein sequences. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Existing reinforced concrete (RC) bridges are subjected to environmental erosion and vehicle loads. It is becoming an urgent problem to evaluate the safety condition of bridge structures combining inspection data with artificial intelligence methods. This paper proposes a data-driven capacity assessment framework for existing RC bridges. The load capacity limit state (LCLS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) prediction model are established based on the proposed information fusion machine learning model. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimized support vector machine (SVM) learner is established to capture the relationship between the feature variables and the LSLS or SLS. Forty-five samples are obtained by static and dynamic simulation of the ANSYS models. Five-dimensional parameters are adopted as the key input parameters of the model, including the maximum dynamic deflection, crack opening ratio, and crack normal damage ratio at midspan, 1/4 span, and 3/4 span. The Shapley additive explanations method is proposed to conduct parameters sensitivity analysis. The results show that the GA-SVM regression algorithm in LCLS and SLS reduction factor prediction is better than the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The crack opening ratio is the most critical parameter that can considerably affect the outcomes of the LCLS and SLS prediction. © Korean Society of Civil Engineers 2024.},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements across diverse domains, manifesting considerable capabilities in evolutionary computation, notably in generating new solutions and automating algorithm design. Surrogate-assisted selection plays a pivotal role in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), especially in addressing expensive optimization problems by reducing the number of real function evaluations. However, whether LLMs can serve as surrogate models remains an unknown. In this study, we propose a novel surrogate model based purely on LLM inference capabilities, eliminating the need for training. Specifically, we formulate model-assisted selection as a classification problem or a regression problem, utilizing LLMs to directly evaluate the quality of new solutions based on historical data. This involves predicting whether a solution is good or bad, or approximating its value. This approach is then integrated into EAs, termed LLM-assisted EA (LAEA). Detailed experiments compared the visualization results of 2D data from 9 mainstream LLMs, as well as their performance on 5-10 dimensional problems. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have significant potential as surrogate models in evolutionary computation, achieving performance comparable to traditional surrogate models only using inference. This work offers new insights into the application of LLMs in evolutionary computation. Code is available at: https://github.com/hhyqhh/LAEA.git. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Data about antibiotic de-escalation in sepsis associated with the bloodstream and caused by Enterobacterales are scarce. The objectives of this study are to identify factors associated with early de-escalation and to analyse the impact of de-escalation on mortality in patients with Enterobacterales bloodstream infection (BSI) with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2. Methods: A prospective, multicentre cohort study was performed including episodes of BSI due to Enterobacterales and a SOFA score ≥ 2 who were receiving an active antipseudomonal β-lactam; the isolate should be susceptible to at least 1 narrower-spectrum antibiotic. Variables associated with de-escalation were identified using logistic binary regression. The association of de-escalation with 30-day mortality was investigated. Confounding was controlled by calculating a propensity score used as covariate, as matching variable, and for inverse probability treatment weighting. Results: Of the 582 patients included, de-escalation was performed in 311 (53.4%). Neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.18–0.75), central venous catheter (aOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.32–0.83), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing isolate (aOR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.17–0.48) were negatively associated with de-escalation, and urinary tract source was positively associated (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.56–3.33). The 30-day mortality was 6.8% (21 patients) in de-escalated patients and 14.4% (39) in not de-escalated patients (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI = 0.44–0.89). In multivariate analysis including the propensity score, de-escalation was not associated with mortality (AOR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.39–2.47) and was protective in the case of urinary or biliary tract source (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.09–1.06). Matched and inverse probability treatment weighting analysis showed similar results.

Utilizing the model's extensive context capacity for iterative prompting without feedback, we sought to autonomously generate superior algorithmic versions. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the improvements did not progress linearly. Nevertheless, one iteration stood out significantly, consistently outperforming the baseline across various pairwise comparisons and showing a robust performance profile. This iteration's structure deviated substantially from traditional SOMA principles, underscoring the potential of large language models to create distinctive and effective algorithmic strategies. The results affirm the methodology's ability to produce high-performing algorithms without expert intervention, setting the stage for future research to integrate feedback mechanisms and conduct detailed code analyses to understand further the modifications made by the Large Language Models.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This imbalance marginalizes minoritized languages, making equitable access to NLP technologies more difficult for languages with lower resources, such as Galician. We present the first two generative LLMs focused on Galician to bridge this gap. These models, freely available as open-source resources, were trained using a GPT architecture with 1.3B parameters on a corpus of 2.1B words. Leveraging continual pretraining, we adapt to Galician two existing LLMs trained on larger corpora, thus mitigating the data constraints that would arise if the training were performed from scratch. The models were evaluated using human judgments and task-based datasets from standardized benchmarks. These evaluations reveal a promising performance, underscoring the importance of linguistic diversity in generative models. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.},

	abstract = {In this work, we provide a new explanation of the ethylene carbonate (EC)–propylene carbonate (PC) disparity, addressing a problem that has challenged the Li-ion battery community for over three decades. We focused on the differences in physical, rather than chemical, properties between EC- and PC-based solvents to explain the differences in the interphase formation properties on the graphitic anode. By probing solid–liquid interfaces before solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, we attributed the difference to the hindered kinetics of solvated Li+ co-intercalation into graphite at the early stage of SEI formation on the EC-graphite interface. This hindrance is due to enrichment of the interfacial region with EC molecules, which increases the local liquidus temperature of the electrolyte (Tm = 36.4 °C for EC and −48.8 °C for PC), as evidenced by the increased interfacial stiffness. The absence of such kinetic limitations for solvated Li+ ion intercalation in the PC electrolyte leads to a higher degree of co-intercalation of solvated molecules into graphite, resulting in severe graphite expansion upon reduction, followed by the SEI cracking along the edge plane. The following continuous co-intercalation of solvated Li+ closes the “co-intercalation-expansion-cracking” loop. This explains why a pure PC electrolyte cannot form a stable SEI on graphite. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024.},

	abstract = {Genetic programming (GP) is a popular problem-solving and optimization technique. However, generating effective test cases for training and evaluating GP programs requires strong domain knowledge. Furthermore, GP programs often prematurely converge on local optima when given excessively difficult problems early in their training. Curriculum learning (CL) has been effective in addressing similar issues across different reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but it requires the manual generation of progressively difficult test cases as well as their careful scheduling. In this work, we leverage the domain knowledge and the strong generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate effective test cases of increasing difficulties and schedule them according to various curricula. We show that by integrating a curriculum scheduler with LLM-generated test cases we can effectively train a GP agent player with environments-based curricula for a single-player game and opponent-based curricula for a multi-player game. Finally, we discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing this method for other problem domains. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

Understanding this choice is crucial because (de)securitization processes can prescribe possible foreign policy options and thus affect the likelihood of conflict and cooperation. To account for leaders’ choices, I draw on political psychology and demonstrate the utility of my approach through an explanation of two US presidents’ preferences for (de)securitizing North Korea. Using leadership trait and operational code analysis, I show that psychological variables shaped Bill Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s preferences because they affected their threat perception and inclination toward conflictual or cooperative actions. These preferences had substantial consequences: While Clinton’s desecuritization attempt led to improvements in US–North Korean relations, Bush’s effort to resecuritize North Korea effectively reversed this progress. © The Author(s) (2024).},

Therefore, this research presents an integrated deep learning-based framework for soil moisture prediction, where long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, an attention mechanism, and fully connected layers are combined. In this framework, LSTM layers are applied to extract the complicated, long- and short-term dependencies from the time series soil moisture data. Besides, the attention mechanism is employed to learn the discriminative information from the extracted features. The genetic algorithm (GA), which aims to enhance the prediction accuracy, is applied to simultaneously determine the hyperparameters of the proposed network, called the GA-LSTM-ATT, consisting of the LSTM layer count, the hidden units in layers, the rate of dropout, and the learning rate. The experimental consequences have indicated that the GA-LSTM-ATT method outperforms the benchmark approaches in different evaluation indices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Heart Failure (HF) poses a challenge for our health systems, and early detection of Worsening HF (WHF), defined as a deterioration in symptoms and clinical and instrumental signs of HF, is vital to improving prognosis. Predicting WHF in a phase that is currently undiagnosable by physicians would enable prompt treatment of such events in patients at a higher risk of WHF. Although the role of Artificial Intelligence in cardiovascular diseases is becoming part of clinical practice, especially for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, its usage is often considered not completely reliable due to the incapacity of these models to provide a valid explanation about their output results. Physicians are often reluctant to make decisions based on unjustified results and see these models as black boxes. This study aims to develop a novel diagnostic model capable of predicting WHF while also providing an easy interpretation of the outcomes. We propose a threshold-based binary classifier built on a mathematical model derived from the Genetic Programming approach. This model clearly indicates that WHF is closely linked to creatinine, sPAP, and CAD, even though the relationship of these variables and WHF is almost complex. However, the proposed mathematical model allows for providing a 3D graphical representation, which medical staff can use to better understand the clinical situation of patients. Experiments conducted using retrospectively collected data from 519 patients treated at the HF Clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model, surpassing the most commonly used machine learning algorithms. Indeed, the proposed GP-based classifier achieved a 96% average score for all considered evaluation metrics and fully supported the controls of medical staff. Our solution has the potential to impact clinical practice for HF by identifying patients at high risk of WHF and facilitating more rapid diagnosis, targeted treatment, and a reduction in hospitalizations. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The process parameters directly affect the quality and performance of laser welding (LW) by shaping the molten pool appearance. However, with the increase in the dimensions of process parameters and the number of samples, the relationship between process parameters and molten pool often exhibits high levels of uncertainty and nonlinearity. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used for complex LW systems modeling, but they may be limited and unable to fully capture the complex relationships when faced with complex systems. Additionally, traditional ML techniques may lack interpretability within the model, making it difficult to understand the input features and their impact on the output. To address these issues, a method that combines an interpretable multi-task neural network (MTNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. Firstly, an LW experimental platform is constructed, and the orthogonal design is conducted for data collection. In the data preparation stage, the curriculum learning strategy is employed to reorganize the raw experimental data. Subsequently, the MTNN is constructed to automatically learn feature representations among input process parameters, capture nonlinear relationships between data, and share weights across multiple related tasks to improve efficiency and performance. Furthermore, the PSO is designed to determine the constraints and objective functions. In addition, the shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is utilized to calculate the importance of process parameters and enhance the interpretability. Finally, the optimization results are validated, and the results demonstrate that the optimized results of the proposed method have achieved satisfactory performance compared to the traditional ML methods. © 2024},

NGS (next-generation sequencing) was performed for the strain to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbial interactions. NGS revealed 3,910 genes, 3294 genes with protein-coding, and 11 functional genomic regions related to diverse agronomic traits including stress tolerance. We identified the two possible phytohormone biosynthesis approaches from metabolic regions1(terpense→diterpense→betacarotene→xanthoxin→ABA)2(terpense→diterpense→geranyl diphosphate →C20 →GA). Several gene clusters related to the biosynthesis of phytohormones, stress tolerance, and agricultural diversification were predicted. The genome provides insights into the possible mechanisms of this bacterium for stress tolerance and its future applications. The genomic organization of B. pumilus revealed several hallmarks of its plant growth promotion and pathogen suppression activities. Our results provide detailed genomic information for the strain and reveal its potential stress tolerance mechanisms, laying the foundation for developing effective stress tolerance strategies against abiotic stress. © The Author(s) 2024.},

LLMs still encounter issues with loud and unpolished input material despite their outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. TextRefine offers a thorough pretreatment pipeline that refines and cleans the text data before using it in LLMs to overcome this problem. The pipeline includes a number of actions, such as removing social tags, normalizing whitespace, changing all lowercase letters to uppercase, removing stopwords, fixing Unicode issues, contraction unpacking, removing punctuation and accents, and text cleanup. These procedures work together to strengthen the integrity and quality of the input data, which will ultimately improve the efficiency and precision of LLMs. Extensive testing and comparisons with standard techniques show TextRefine’s effectiveness with 99 % of the accuracy. © 2024; Los autores.},

	abstract = {Repairing bugs can be a daunting task for even a human experienced in debugging, so naturally, attempting to automatically repair programs with a computer system is quite challenging. The existing methods of automated program repair leave a lot of room for improvement. Fault localization, which aims to find lines of code that are potentially buggy, minimises the search space of an automated program repair system. Recent work has shown improvement in these fault localization methods, with the use of Large Language Models. Here, we propose a system where a LLM-based fault localization tool, which we call SemiAutoFL, is used within a fully automatic program repair program, ARJA-e. We show that utilising LLM-based fault localization with ARJA-e can significantly improve its performance on real world bugs. ARJA-e with SemiAutoFL can repair 10 bugs that ARJA-e was previously unable to so do. This finding adds to our understanding of how to improve fault localization and automated program repair, highlighting the potential for more efficient and accurate fault localisation methods being applied to automated program repair. © 2024 is held by the owner/author(s).},

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson's ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation is one of the most important sources for renewable energy. However, PV power generation is entirely dependent on the amount of downward solar radiation reaching the solar cells. This is determined by uncertain and uncontrollable meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, as well as other factors such as topographical characteristics. Good solar radiation prediction models can increase energy output while decreasing the operation costs of PV power generation. For example, in some provinces in China, PV stations are required to upload short-term online power forecast information to power dispatching agencies. Numerous AI, statistical, and numerical weather prediction models have been used in many real-world renewable energy applications, with a focus on modeling accuracy. However, there is a need for explainable AI models that could be easily understood, analyzed, and augmented by the stakeholders. In this article, we present a compact, explainable, and lifelong learning metaheuristic-based interval type-2 fuzzy logic system for solar radiation modeling. The generated model will be composed of a small number of short IF-Then rules that have been optimized via simulated annealing to produce models with high prediction accuracy. These models are updated through a life-long learning approach to maximize their accuracy and maintain interpretability. In the process of lifelong learning, the proposed method transferred the model's knowledge to new geographical locations with minimal forgetting. The proposed method achieved good prediction accuracy and outperformed on new geographical locations other transparent and black-box models by 13.2% as well as maintaining excellent generalization ability. The resulting models have been evaluated and accepted by experts, and thanks to the generated transparency, the experts were able to augment the models with their expertise, which increased the models' accuracy.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many evolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to assist with job scheduling in manufacturing. One of the main approaches is genetic algorithms (GAs). However, due to their complexity, users may need help understanding or communicating GA applications, preventing their widespread acceptance among factory workers. The concept of explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to address this issue. This study reviews existing XAI techniques for explaining GA applications in job scheduling and summarizes the problems existing XAI techniques face. Several novel XAI techniques are proposed to solve these problems, including decision tree-based interpretation, dynamic transformation and contribution diagrams, and improved bar charts. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, it is applied to a case from the literature. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology can compensate for the deficiencies of existing XAI methods in handling high-dimensional data and visualizing the contribution of feasible solutions, thereby satisfying all the requirements for an effective XAI technique for explaining GA applications in job scheduling. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to explain other evolutionary AI applications in job scheduling, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This enables EXA-GP to utilize the full suite of optimizations provided by EXAMM, such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, island based populations with re-population events, as well as Lamarckian weight inheritance and backpropagation for optimization of constant values. Results show that EXA-GP's evolved genetic programs achieve the same levels of accuracy as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) evolved by EXAMM, while at the same time being more explainable. EXA-GP's genetic programs are also computationally less complex than EXAMM's RNNs, suggesting that GP operations may actually be more effective than gated recurrent memory cells for time series forecasting. We also show that EXAMM and EXA-GP outperform state-of-the-art GP and recurrent CGPANN algorithms which struggle on these benchmarks.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have high ischemic risk, data on the efficacy and safety of the de-escalation strategy of switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel are lacking. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the outcomes of the de-escalation strategy compared with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor in stabilized patients with AMI and high ischemic risk following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a post hoc analysis of the Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel in Stabilized Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (TALOS-AMI) trial, an open-label, assessor-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Patients with AMI who had no event during 1 month of ticagrelor-based DAPT after PCI were included. High ischemic risk was defined as having a history of diabetes or chronic kidney disease, multivessel PCI, at least 3 lesions treated, total stent length greater than 60 mm, at least 3 stents implanted, left main PCI, or bifurcation PCI with at least 2 stents. Data were collected from February 14, 2014, to January 21, 2021, and analyzed from December 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to either de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel or ticagrelor-based DAPT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemic outcomes (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis) and bleeding outcomes (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding) were evaluated. RESULTS Of 2697 patients with AMI (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [11.4] years; 454 [16.8%] female), 1371 (50.8%; 684 assigned to de-escalation and 687 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) had high ischemic risk features and a significantly higher risk of ischemic outcomes than those without high ischemic risk (1326 patients [49.2%], including 665 assigned to de-escalation and 661 assigned to ticagrelor-based DAPT) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.15-2.63; P =.01). De-escalation to clopidogrel, compared with ticagrelor-based DAPT, showed no significant difference in ischemic risk across the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54-1.45; P =.62) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28; P =.21), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.47). The bleeding risk of the de-escalation group was consistent in both the high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.11; P =.11) and the non-high ischemic risk group (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.75; P =.003), without heterogeneity (P for interaction =.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In stabilized patients with AMI, the ischemic and bleeding outcomes of an unguided de-escalation strategy with clopidogrel compared with a ticagrelor-based DAPT strategy were consistent without significant interaction, regardless of the presence of high ischemic risk. © 2023 American Medical Association.

	abstract = {Skin cancer is among the most prevalent cancers globally, emphasizing the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis to improve outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, based on visual examination, are subjective, time-intensive, and require specialized expertise. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for skin cancer detection face challenges such as computational inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and reliance on standalone CNN architectures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a comprehensive pipeline combining transfer learning, feature selection, and machine-learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy. Multiple pretrained CNN models were evaluated, with Xception emerging as the optimal choice for its balance of computational efficiency and performance. An ablation study further validated the effectiveness of freezing task-specific layers within the Xception architecture. Feature dimensionality was optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization, reducing dimensions from 1024 to 508, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Machine-learning classifiers, including Subspace KNN and Medium Gaussian SVM, further improved classification accuracy. Evaluated on the ISIC 2018 and HAM10000 datasets, the proposed pipeline achieved impressive accuracies of 98.5% and 86.1%, respectively. Moreover, Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM, LIME, and Occlusion Sensitivity, enhanced interpretability. This approach provides a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution for automated skin cancer diagnosis in clinical applications. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the current era, a lot of research is being done in the domain of disease diagnosis using machine learning. In recent times, one of the deadliest respiratory diseases, COVID-19, which causes serious damage to the lungs has claimed a lot of lives globally. Machine learning-based systems can assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of the disease, which can reduce the deadly effects of the disease. For the successful deployment of these machine learning-based systems, hyperparameter-based optimization and feature selection are important issues. Motivated by the above, in this proposal, we design an improved model to predict the existence of respiratory disease among patients by incorporating hyperparameter optimization and feature selection. To optimize the parameters of the machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter optimization with a genetic algorithm is proposed and to reduce the size of the feature set, feature selection is performed using binary grey wolf optimization algorithm. Moreover, to enhance the efficacy of the predictions made by hyperparameter-optimized machine learning models, an ensemble model is proposed using a stacking classifier. Also, explainable AI was incorporated to define the feature importance by making use of Shapely adaptive explanations (SHAP) values. For the experimentation, the publicly accessible Mexico clinical dataset of COVID-19 was used. The results obtained show that the proposed model has superior prediction accuracy in comparison to its counterparts. Moreover, among all the hyperparameter-optimized algorithms, adaboost algorithm outperformed all the other hyperparameter-optimized algorithms.

	abstract = {Groundwater storage (GWS) decline, as well as total water storage (TWS) decline, in the (semi)arid Ordos Basin (China) poses great challenges to the water supply and ecological environment. In this study, the major factors causing the rapid loss of water storage during 2003–2020 are first investigated using correlation analysis, where the storage estimates are derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. The major hydroclimatic drivers of monthly water storage changes are then explored among precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (RO) using an interpretable deep learning (IDL) method. The relative contribution of each driver is quantified by leveraging the interpretability nature of IDL. Results show that the GWS depletion (–0.82 cm/year) primarily accounts for the TWS loss (–0.73 cm/year) in the Ordos Basin under increased precipitation. The decreased TWS and GWS are both closely related to the increased vegetation density and coal production, indicating that they are the major drivers of the long-term water loss. At the monthly scale, the IDL method reveals that P and ET contribute over 75% to the changes of both TWS and GWS in most regions. The response lag of TWS to P and ET is generally 1–3 months. In contrast, GWS shows a more complicated response to P and ET with a longer lag range of 1–11 months in different regions due to the complicated Ordos Basin aquifer systems. These findings achieve a better understanding of hydrologic cycles and better guide sustainable water resources management in the Ordos Basin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Association of Hydrogeologists.},

	abstract = {Fly ash slag concrete (FASC), a supplementary cementitious material, has transformed construction by lowering the carbon footprint, minimizing waste, reducing labor costs, and improving durability and precision. Predicting compressive strength (CS), a key mechanical property, is essential for optimal performance. Due to the nonlinear nature of FASC mixtures, researchers now utilize machine learning tools. This study evaluates three machine learning models by combining traditional AI algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), with nature-inspired optimization techniques, such as chicken swarm optimization (CSO), moth flame optimization algorithm (MOFA), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA). By addressing the gaps in mechanical property variation, dataset scope, and model comparison, this study demonstrated high accuracy in CS prediction for all three models. The ANN optimized by WOA consistently excelled across multiple metrics.

	abstract = {Background: In the EC-CRT-001 phase II study, the combination of toripalimab (an anti-programmed death-1 antibody) and definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has shown promising efficacy in patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we reported the long-term outcomes and post-hoc exploratory analyses. Methods: This single-arm, phase II trial enrolled 42 patients diagnosed with unresectable stage I–IVA ESCC was conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between November 2019 and January 2021. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy (weekly 50 mg/m2 of paclitaxel and 25 mg/m2 of cisplatin for five cycles), concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), and toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year). The primary endpoint was clinical complete response (CR) rate at 3 months after CRT completion. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were evaluated. Additionally, the exploratory objectives included analysing recurrence patterns, assessing the associations between immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and efficacy, and identifying potential predictors for irAEs. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04005170). Findings: With a median follow-up of 44.3 months (IQR 40.8–46.1), the 3-year OS and PFS rates were 44.8% (95% CI 31.9–62.8) and 35.7% (95% CI 23.8–53.6), respectively. Patients who failed to achieve a clinical complete response (CR) demonstrated significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 13.73, 95% CI 4.43–42.54, P < 0.0001) and PFS (HR = 32.08, 95% CI 8.57–120.10, P < 0.0001). Disease recurrence occurred in 23 of 42 patients (55%), with recurrences being earlier and more frequent in the non-CR group compared to the CR group. Patients experiencing irAEs showed a significantly higher CR rate (72% vs. 39%, P = 0.082) and better PFS (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19–0.93, P = 0.027) than those without irAEs. GON4L mutation was associated with a lower incidence of irAEs (P = 0.036). Interpretation: The updated survival outcomes confirmed the efficacy of toripalimab plus definitive CRT in locally advanced ESCC. Moreover, the development of irAEs may predict a more favourable prognosis.

	abstract = {As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is one of the most prominent algorithms to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Despite numerous successful applications, several studies have shown that the NSGA-II is less effective for larger numbers of objectives. In this work, we use mathematical runtime analyses to rigorously demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon. We show that even on the simple $m$ -objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in subexponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently. This is not a problem for two objectives, where any sorting of a pairwise incomparable set of solutions according to one objective is also such a sorting according to the other objective (in the inverse order). © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the scientific community to expedite therapeutic drug discovery. The partnership between biomedical scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) specialists has resulted in the creation of several computational tools for the preliminary assessment of antiviral drugs. One such category of drugs comprises antiviral peptides (AVPs) that are part of an organism's initial immune response to viral invasion and infection. The models developed to identify AVPs do not offer any insight into the characteristics that significantly contribute to their antiviral nature. So, a domain expert needs a thorough analysis to choose the most potent AVPs among the ones found by such models in antiviral proteins before going for synthesis. This work aims to accelerate this process by proposing a fully automated in silico framework that identifies AVPs in antiviral protein chains and optimizes them based on some desirable characteristics identified by analyzing the existing AVPs through an explainable machine learning model. This model has been built using extreme gradient boosting and has an accuracy of 90%, which is better than the existing classifiers. The two characteristics found by this explainable model conflict with each other's optimization; hence, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms are used to find the pareto-optimal AVPs by establishing a trade-off between them. To evaluate the efficacy of the suggested framework, we found and optimized the AVPs present in some well-known antiviral proteins. The pareto-optimal AVPs were identified and proposed for synthesis and validation of antiviral activity. Lastly, a free online app has been deployed at https://avpdesign.anvil.app. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, we use highly developed machine learning techniques to accurately estimate the Compressive Strength (CS) of blended concrete, considering its composition, including cement, SCMs (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) and Fly Ash (FA)), water, superplasticizer, fine/coarse aggregate, and curing age. In addition to these, we examine an array of models, including XGBoost, Decision Trees (DT), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Linear Regression (LR). Among them, XGBoost has the best performance in every category. We use the Bayesian optimization method for hyperparameter fine-tuning to improve forecast accuracy. Our in-depth examination demonstrates the better predictive skills of ensemble models like RF and XGBoost over LR, which is limited in capturing data complexity beyond linear relationships. With an R2 of 0.952, RMSE of 4.88, MAE of 3.24, and MAPE of 9.94%, XGBoost performs noticeably better than its rivals. Using SHAP analysis, we determine that curing age, water content and cement concentration are the main factors influencing the model’s predictive capacity, with the contributions of superplasticizer and fly ash being minimal. Curing age and cement content have an interesting positive association with CS, but water content has a negative link with CS. These results highlight the value of machine learning, especially the effectiveness of XGBoost, as a potent device for forecasting the CS of mixed concrete. Additionally, the knowledge gained from our research provides designers and researchers in concrete materials with useful direction, highlighting the most important factors for compressive strength. Future studies should work toward additional optimization by attempting to verify these models across a wider variety of concrete compositions and test settings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem, recognized as the seventh cause of death in the world. One of the most debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus is the diabetic foot (DF), resulting in an increased risk of hospitalization and significant morbidity and mortality. Amputation above or below the knee is a feared complication and the mortality in these patients is higher than for most forms of cancer. Identifying and interpreting relationships existing among the factors involved in DF diagnosis is still challenging. Although machine learning approaches have proven to achieve great accuracy in DF prediction, few advances have been performed in understanding how they make such predictions, resulting in mistrust of their use in real contexts. In this study, we present an approach based on Genetic Programming to build a simple global explainable classifier, named X-GPC, which, unlike existing tools such as LIME and SHAP, provides a global interpretation of the DFU diagnosis through a mathematical model. Also, an easy consultable 3d graph is provided, which could be used by the medical staff to figure out the patients’ situation and take decisions for patients’ healing. Experimental results obtained by using a real-world dataset have shown the ability of the proposal to diagnose DF with an accuracy of 100% outperforming other techniques of the state-of-the-art. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The research was carried out with 180 students. The number of samples was determined by power analysis (a=0.05,b=0.20, effect size=0.25). Participants were pre-screened and divided into 4 groups with the closest group mean (group 1: control group: the group that did not take anatomy lessons, group 2: video-assisted anatomy education, group 3: 3D anatomy course, group 4: classical anatomy education group). The courses in the training groups were organised as 4 hours/day, 2 days/week for 5 weeks. At the end of the course, the students were re-examined and scaled to determine the difference in scores and self-efficacy between the groups. A one-way ANOVA test was performed because the data were normally distributed when comparing between groups. The mean scores were calculated as group 1=30.22±6.24, group 2=39.02±9.15, group 3=49.77±9.20 and group 4=59.28±8.95. In the post hoc comparison, in pairwise comparisons between all groups, the differences were highly significant (p<0.001). According to the results of the self-efficacy scale, the groups were ranked as group 4>group 3>group 2>group 1 (p<0.001). According to the results of this study, the laboratory method in skeletal anatomy teaching is the best alternative to 3D anatomy teaching. © 2023, Universidad de la Frontera. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The job shop scheduling problem is an important combinatorial optimisation problem in the real world. Genetic programming hyper-heuristic has been successfully applied to automatically evolve effective dispatching rules to make a schedule in real time without much domain knowledge. However, the interpretability of GP-evolved rules has been largely neglected, which could lead to the lack of reliability and trustworthiness of the evolved rules in practice. Current work related to interpretable genetic programming algorithms primarily uses the model size as the interpretability metric. This could not fully reflect the interpretability of evolved rules. To overcome the limitation, we employ structural complexity and dimension gap as more comprehensive interpretability measures. In addition, a new multi-objective genetic programming algorithm, which applies the a non-dominated sorting method to solve the objective selection bias issue, is proposed to optimise the makespan (scheduling objective), structural complexity and dimension gap simultaneously. A variety of experiments demonstrates the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm based on effectiveness, convergence and diversity. Furthermore, the semantics of evolved dispatching rules are analysed to show their better interpretability.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is crucial for improving the water use efficiency and designing and operating irrigation systems. To accurately calculate winter wheat ETc with limited meteorological data, the present study proposed two interpretable machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) as well as non-interpretable ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN)) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using observed winter wheat ETc data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at Luan Cheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to assess the performance of models. This demonstrated that the ML models based on the crop coefficient (Kc) and solar radiation (Rn) were accurate and offered a workaround for calculating winter wheat ETc in the absence of meteorological data. In four ML models, the ninth input combination, consisting of Kc, Rn, daily air maximum temperature (Tmax), daily air minimum temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (n), and wind speed with a height of 2 m (U2), produced the best estimate of ETc. Among them, the PSO-based SVM (PSO-SVM) model obtained the best results for estimating ETc with MAE, RMSE, NSE, R2, and GPI values of 0.389 mm·d−1, 0.562 mm·d−1 0.910, 0.911, and 0.975, respectively, showing the advantages of the non-interpretable ML model in ETc forecasting. Accurate descriptions of actual hydrological and climatic processes were given by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The inflection points of daily climatic parameters (Tmin, Tmax, Rn, n) related to ETc were determined to be 3.80 °C, 5.50 °C, 1.62 MJ·m−2·d−1, 1.37 h, respectively. This work has potential to overcome the difficulty of measuring winter wheat ETc properly due to the lack of meteorological data and accomplish appropriate water management to conserve water and increase water productivity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This runs counter to the traditional interpretations of De Caelo I.2, which consider how, and how completely, Aristotle uses the differentiation of simple magnitudes to differentiate simple bodies, and which assume that he introduces the notion of a simple body independently of the notion of a simple motion. But the traditional interpretations miss the point of Aristotle’s argument in De Caelo I.2, which – so I argue – is to introduce the notion of simple motions, using this to introduce the notion of simple bodies, and to thereby provide an explanatory account of all possible locomotion. This is the reason why Aristotle identifies simple bodies in De Caelo I.2 with the fundamental components of the universe. © Jiayu Zhang, 2024.},

Methodology/approach: Using analysis of variance and linear regression tests, we conducted data analysis on both direct relationships and mediations with a sample consisting of 217 university students. Main results: We identified that the need for safety positively influences entrepreneurial motivation. We also recognized that this result occurs through the double sequential mediation of entrepreneurial motivation and regulatory focus. Thus, students with a promotional regulatory focus were more willing to undertake than those whose regulatory focus is on prevention. Theoretical/methodological contributions: Higgins and Pinelli (2020) indicated that entrepreneurship rarely uses regulatory focus theory despite it being adequate. Furthermore, the economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic may be a factor that influences the motivation to undertake, as it is an extrinsic motivation driven by the need for security. Relevance/originality: We identified that the need for security can trigger the motivation to undertake, making individuals present a state of promotional self-regulation. Social/management contributions: Based on the results, it can be stated that entrepreneurial education should address different types of communication in order to encourage future entrepreneurs. Clarification of the gain is commonly applied in classrooms, but no-loss communication should also be adopted. © ANEGEPE, São Paulo-SP. All rights reserved.},

The quantitative part (Phase 2) is a survey study of 243 teachers from the randomly sampled 21 kindergartens regarding their EVAE beliefs and practices. Most teachers believe in child-centred teaching while practising teacher-directed instruction and support creativity while delivering closed-ended instruction. Four influential factors are identified to account for this gap: (1) practising child-centred pedagogies as a result of behavioural beliefs; (2) undervaluing visual arts as a result of normative beliefs; (3) instructing children directly as a result of normative beliefs; and (4) delivering subject knowledge in studio teaching as a result of control beliefs. These findings imply that Hong Kong kindergarten teachers struggle between two approaches and suffer from a lack of support from educational authorities and society. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate practices for visual arts education in Hong Kong kindergartens. © 2022 The Author(s).

In disciplinary genres, whose production is demanding, having evidence of factors to scaffold its construction is a key aspect. However, more studies are needed to understand the characteristics of MR and the relation with texts written by students in disciplinary genres. This study analyzes the relation between MR and the quality of scientific explanations written by 359 4th grade elementary students in two didactic units. We characterized RM performances in five dimensions (discursive, textual, grammatical, lexical-semantic, conceptual). Regression models showed that performance in RM predicts the quality of explanations, with a different contribution per dimension and didactic unit. In addition, performance in the conceptual dimension for unit 1 significantly predicted the quality of explanations for unit 2. Our study shows that MR is a variable associated with textual construction that we recommend enhancing in future instructional proposals. © (2024), (Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo).

To measure fiscal de/centralization, the study constructs original data sets based on reports from various organizations over multiple years. The analysis results demonstrate that fiscal de/centralization varies temporally and spatially. While improved capacity is associated with enhanced own-source revenue, the desire to improve regional fiscal management often results in fiscal centralization. Further, although Ethiopian regions have constitutional powers to determine the bases and rates of regional taxes, the central government has significant influence in such matters, often manipulating regional affairs in disregard of the constitution. The article reveals substantial variations of own-source revenues across regions attributed to regional differences in capacity, development, location, and investment distribution. The article highlights the importance of a systematic understanding of region-specific challenges to accurately assess the effectiveness of decentralization policies in the global South. Insights from Ethiopia are of great importance to policymakers looking to embrace fiscal decentralization in developing countries. © 2023 The Authors.

Large language models (LLM) have the potential to help improve productivity by serving as conversational agents that effectively function as subject-matter experts. In this paper we demonstrate Ask-EDA, a chat agent designed to serve as a 24×7 expert available to provide guidance to design engineers. Ask-EDA leverages LLM, hybrid retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and abbreviation de-hallucination (ADH) techniques to deliver more relevant and accurate responses. We curated three evaluation datasets, namely q2a-100, cmds-100 and abbr-100. Each dataset is tailored to assess a distinct aspect: general design question answering, design command handling and abbreviation resolution. We demonstrated that hybrid RAG offers over a 40% improvement in Recall on the q2a-100 dataset and over a 60% improvement on the cmds-100 dataset compared to not using RAG, while ADH yields over a 70% enhancement in Recall on the abbr-100 dataset. The evaluation results show that Ask-EDA can effectively respond to design-related inquiries.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {—Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully used to evolve routing policies that can make real-time routing decisions for uncertain arc routing problems. Although the evolved routing policies are highly effective, they are typically very large and complex, and hard to be understood and trusted by real users. Existing studies have attempted to improve the interpretability by developing new GP approaches to evolve both effective and interpretable (e.g., with smaller program size) routing policies. However, they still have limitations due to the tradeoff between effectiveness and interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a new post-hoc explanation approach to explaining the effective but complex routing policies evolved by GP. The new approach includes a local ranking explanation and a global explanation module. The local ranking explanation uses particle swarm optimization to learn an interpretable linear model that accurately explains the local behavior of the routing policy for each decision situation. Then, the global explanation module uses a clustering technique to summarize the local explanations into a global explanation. The experimental results and case studies on the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can obtain accurate and understandable explanations of the routing policies evolved for uncertain arc routing problems. Our explanation approach is not restricted to uncertain arc routing, but has a great potential to be generalized to other optimization and machine learning problems, such as learning classifier systems and reinforcement learning. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a cutting-edge AI development motivated by the need for transparency of black-box models in AI systems. This transparency enhances user trust, facilitates accountability, and enables a better understanding of AI systems decisions, especially in critical applications where insights into decision processes are essential. These benefits have increased XAI research interest, aiming to provide techniques for interpreting and understanding the behavior of intelligent models. Counterfactual explanation is a popular technique for model interpretation based on updating a few features such that the outcome of an AI model is changed. Users can gain insights into the critical features or factors influencing the AI system's decision by analyzing these counterfactuals. However, most counterfactual techniques require more qualifications, such as simplicity, robustness, and coherence. In this research, we propose a novel approach, Adaptive Feature Weight Genetic Explanation (AFWGE), for generating counterfactual explanations of AI models, where a custom genetic algorithm (GA) is employed, incorporating adaptive feature weights to enhance the algorithm's performance. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AFWGE allows for the adaptation of feature weights during the evolutionary process, producing more effective counterfactual explanations with superior proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and actionability. Furthermore, it emphasizes feature weights as reliable indicators of the significance of the model's features, providing valuable insights for interpreting the model. AFWGE not only advances the field of counterfactual explanation generation but also establishes a robust framework for assessing feature importance in machine learning models.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has received great interest in the recent decade, due to its importance in critical application domains, such as self-driving cars, law, and healthcare. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for machine learning. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly considered in GP until recently, following the surge in the popularity of XAI. This article provides a comprehensive review of the studies on GP that can potentially improve the model interpretability, both explicitly and implicitly, as a byproduct. We group the existing studies related to explainable artificial intelligence by GP into two categories. The first category considers the intrinsic interpretability, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP. The second category focuses on post-hoc interpretability, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models, or explain the models evolved by GP by simpler models such as linear models. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the strong potential of GP for improving the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing the complex tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

The ability to relate key information regarding algorithm behaviour and drivers of solution quality to an end-user is vital. This paper investigates a novel method of explanatory feature extraction based on analysis of the search trajectory and compares the results to those of sensitivity analysis using “Weighted Ranked Biased Overlap”. We apply these techniques to search trajectories generated by a genetic algorithm as it solves a staff rostering problem. We show that there is a significant overlap between these two explainability methods when identifying subsets of rostered workers whose allocations are responsible for large portions of fitness change in an optimization run. Both methods identify similar patterns in sensitivity, but our method also draws out additional information. As the search progresses, the techniques reveal how individual workers increase or decrease in the influence on the overall rostering solution’s quality. Our method also helps identify workers with a lower impact on overall solution fitness and at what stage in the search these individuals can be considered highly flexible in their roster assignment. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {In the fast-paced world of software development, ensuring software quality is paramount. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) plays a vital role, primarily through testing, which can be carried out manually or automatically. Yet, creating comprehensive test data (TD) for web applications can be a formidable task. Manual test data generation (TDG) is time-consuming and error prone. Automation of TDG has become increasingly important in the realm of software quality assurance as it enables efficient and effective testing of software systems. The need for an appropriate framework for automated TDG is critical to achieve comprehensive and reliable test coverage. Automated TDG offers significant advantages, including time and resource savings, improved test coverage, and seamless integration into the software development process. The core aim of this research is to bridge the gap between manual and existing automated methods, resulting in time and cost savings, heightened testing efficiency, and elevated software quality. Research objectives encompass comparing the adaptability of an AGA based automated TDG model and a LLM based automated TDG model to a web application. The results from the LLM model for triangle classification program was found to be potentially acceptable and accurate than the AGA model’s results. This research discusses the challenges encountered when implementing and using the AGA-based framework in the web application context and how an LLM model could overcome the challenges. The study highlights the benefits of using the LLM approach, demonstrating its relevance and accuracy in generating test data compared to the Genetic Algorithm-based model. The practical implications for software quality assurance practices are discussed, emphasizing the enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM model in improving software quality. © 2024 IEEE.},

In recent years, deep learning methods have demonstrated superior prediction outcomes compared to conventional numerical models. However, due to limited observational data, most of these deep learning methods learn information from simulation data derived from physical models, and ensuring the quality of such simulation data can prove challenging. As a result, the models in CMIP5/6 were recombined using genetic algorithms (GAs) to create our training dataset. A deep learning model was then used to learn features from the output of these combined CMIP models so that these physical numerical models can complement each other. To address the issue of inadequate spatiotemporal feature extraction present in many deep learning methods, we devised an ENSO deep learning regression model. An improved self-attention mechanism was introduced into the convolutional LSTM (long short-term memory) network to enable our model to better extract local and global spatiotemporal features. With our method and model, we were able to obtain less erroneous forecast results, and our method surpassed other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of its capability for long-term forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Early skin cancer diagnosis saves lives as the disease can be successfully treated through complete excision. Computer-aided diagnosis methods are developed using artificial intelligence techniques to help earlier detection and identify hidden causes leading to cancers in skin lesion images. In skin cancer image classification problems, an ensemble of classifiers has demonstrated better classification ability than a single classification algorithm. Traditionally, training an ensemble uses the complete set of original features, where some of these features can be redundant or irrelevant and hence, may not provide useful information in generating good models for ensemble classification. Moreover, newly created features may help improve classification performance. To address this issue, the existing methods have used feature construction for building an ensemble classifier, which usually creates a fixed number of features that may fit the training data too well, resulting in poor test performance. This study develops a novel classification approach that combines ensemble learning, feature selection, and feature construction utilizing genetic programming (GP) to handle the above limitations. The proposed method automatically evolves variable-length feature vectors consisting of GP-selected and GP-constructed features suitable for training an ensemble classifier. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark real-world skin image datasets that include dermoscopy and standard camera images. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network methods, the existing GP approaches, and 11 commonly used machine learning methods. Furthermore, this study also includes interpreting evolved individuals that highlight important skin cancer characteristics playing a vital role in discriminating images of different cancer classes. This study shows that high classification performance can be achieved at a low cost of computational resources and inference time, and accordingly, this method is potentially suitable to be implemented in mobile devices for the automated screening of skin lesions and many other malignancies in low-resource settings.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Advancing further in the interpretability, we have used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, a Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation technique to indicate CNN's decision-making rationale by selecting influential regions of input images. Our proposed GA-CNN model applied to a comprehensive oral image dataset resulted in a classification accuracy of 93.7%. Our sensitivity and specificity rates were 92.5% and 94.9% improvement over other CNN models available in the literature. We have demonstrated that our GA-based optimization mechanism performs better for parameter searching in the CNN. Our proposed AI tool with an explanation for oral cancer screening will assist clinicians in the early identification of disease, establishing a complementary relationship between human health service providers and machine learning technologies for improved patient outcomes. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: After exposure to a potentially traumatic event, survivors may experience thoughts about ‘what could have happened’, referred to as counterfactual thoughts (CFTs). CFTs have been found to have a negative impact on survivors’ mental health. This is the first study to investigate whether parents of trauma survivors experience CFTs and the association with psychological distress in this group. Objective: The main aim of the present study is to investigate CFTs in parents of trauma survivors and the relationship between the frequency and vividness of CFTs and psychological distress. Method: The participants (N = 310, 191 females) were parents of the youths targeted in the terror attack on Utøya island, Norway, in 2011. Frequency and vividness of CFTs, posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR), and symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured 8.5–9 years post-terror. Results: The majority of the parents (74%) reported having experienced CFTs at some time point since the attack. For almost one-third of the parents, CFTs were still present more than eight years after the attack. Higher frequency and vividness of CFTs were uniquely associated with higher levels of PTSR, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that frequent and vivid CFTs may contribute to mental health problems in parents of trauma survivors and should be addressed in therapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {While interest in artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been renewed by the ubiquitous use of deep learning to solve high-dimensional problems, we are still far from general artificial intelligence. In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature’s brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology},

	abstract = {The drug discovery process can be significantly improved by applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods that learn to generate compounds with desired pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, RL-based methods typically condense the evaluation of sampled compounds into a single scalar value, making it difficult for the generative agent to learn the optimal policy. This work combines self-attention mechanisms and RL to generate promising molecules. The idea is to evaluate the relative significance of each atom and functional group in their interaction with the target, and to utilize this information for optimizing the Generator. Therefore, the framework for de novo drug design is composed of a Generator that samples new compounds combined with a Transformer-encoder and a biological affinity Predictor that evaluate the generated structures. Moreover, it takes the advantage of the knowledge encapsulated in the Transformer’s attention weights to evaluate each token individually. We compared the performance of two output prediction strategies for the Transformer: standard and masked language model (MLM). The results show that the MLM Transformer is more effective in optimizing the Generator compared with the state-of-the-art works. Additionally, the evaluation models identified the most important regions of each molecule for the biological interaction with the target. As a case study, we generated synthesizable hit compounds that can be putative inhibitors of the enzyme ubiquitin-specific protein 7 (USP7). © 2023 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Genetic Programming (GP) has the potential to generate intrinsically explainable models. Despite that, in practice, this potential is not fully achieved because the solutions usually grow too much during the evolution. The excessive growth together with the functional and structural complexity of the solutions increase the computational cost and the risk of overfitting. Thus, many approaches have been developed to prevent the solutions to grow excessively in GP. However, it is still an open question how these approaches can be used for improving the interpretability of the models. This article presents an empirical study of eight structural complexity metrics that have been used as evaluation criteria in multi-objective optimisation. Tree depth, size, visitation length, number of unique features, a proxy for human interpretability, number of operators, number of non-linear operators and number of consecutive nonlinear operators were tested. The results show that potentially the best approach for generating good interpretable GP models is to use the combination of more than one structural complexity metric. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

The high accuracy of creep life prediction and new high creep-strength alloys are needed for safe long-term operation. In this paper, a data-driven method was used to overcome the limitations of the simple-parameter life prediction method that does not consider the complex interactions that occur between many input variables. The explainable artificial intelligence technology, such as the Shaply additive explanation value(SHAP), enables intuitive understanding of the effect of individual variables on creep life and helps to quantitatively evaluate the effect. The artificial intelligence model was optimized using a genetic algorithm, and a method for proposing an optimal alloy composition with a desired creep life could be presented. In this paper, the maximum expected creep life of 58,640 h in the standard component range of ASME SA213 T92 under the conditions of 650 °C and 100 MPa was predicted, and a new alloy composition having a creep life of over 100,000 h under the same conditions is proposed.

This article examines the various actors and factors that have contributed to the urban revitalization of the neighborhoods in Kashan. Utilizing assemblage theory, this article constructs a relational, multiplex, and multiscalar explanation of the process of urban change. Rather than relying on the conventional understanding found in most existing gentrification studies, the aim of this study was to offer a localized interpretation of urban transformation processes. The research findings demonstrate that assemblages of human and non-human factors are shaping and reshaping the historical center of Kashan. Additionally, the findings suggest that the transformations of the historical neighborhoods of Kashan are not only due to the result of a single process but multiple urban processes occurring simultaneously within and outside the historical neighborhoods. These processes include heritage conservation (or requalification), incumbent upgrading, soft forms of revitalization, the initial stages of tourist gentrification, as well as suburbanization and urban sprawl. These dynamics are influenced by a variety of factors at political, economic, cultural, and legislative levels, operating at local, national, and global scales. We suggest that the assemblage approach can be effectively applied to study urban transformations in non-Western cities. © (2024), (Universidade de Lisboa). All rights reserved.},

However, conventional algorithms suffer a trade-off between readability and performance, encouraging the emergence of explainable AI. In this paper, we propose a novel method to form the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) as an explainable AI to retain the model's accuracy and explainability. To achieve this purpose, we first adopted neuroevolution, which combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neural network (NN), and pruned weights to obtain information about the hierarchical decomposition of the Choquet integral. We then fine-tuned the weights of the HCI model for the classification problem. In addition, we use four datasets to illustrate the proposed algorithm and compare the results with the conventional classifiers: decision tree, deep learning, and support vector machine (SVM). The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in terms of accuracy, and keeps the Choquet integral's explainable property, justifying this paper's contribution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Real-time crash risk prediction is a hot topic of emerging technology. Due to the lack of basic risk formation theory, previous studies focussed on the application of complex models to improve the accuracy of prediction, ignoring the interpretation of variables, while the traditional statistical analysis method can interpret variables, but the prediction accuracy is poor, which falls into a dilemma of trade-off. In this study, based on the traffic flow information of elevated expressway, an improved genetic programming (GP) approach with elite gene bank is applied to obtain an explicit traffic flow crash risk function to solve the above trade-off problem. Logistic regression and backward-propagation neural network combined with partial dependency plot were used as baseline methods to examine the interpretability and accuracy of GP. It is found that GP prediction model has been proved to be able to select important variables and solve the trade-off dilemma, which has good interpretability and accuracy. The results show that crash risk in the traffic flow mainly comes from the traffic volume, speed of the upstream section, and the speed of the current section. Furthermore, the error of GP comes from the unobserved heterogeneity and crash mechanism theory is proposed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee.},

	abstract = {A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can learn the relationship between two image domains and achieve unpaired image-to-image translation. One of the breakthroughs was Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), which is a popular method to transfer the content representations from the source domain to the target domain. Existing studies have gradually improved the performance of CycleGAN models by modifying the network structure or loss function of CycleGAN. However, these methods tend to suffer from training instability and the generators lack the ability to acquire the most discriminating features between the source and target domains, thus making the generated images of low fidelity and few texture details. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new method that combines Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Attention Mechanisms to train GANs. Specifically, from an initial CycleGAN, binary vectors indicating the activation of the weights of the generators are progressively improved upon by means of an EA. At the end of this process, the best-performing configurations of generators can be retained for image generation. In addition, to address the issues of low fidelity and lack of texture details on generated images, we make use of the channel attention mechanism. The latter component allows the candidate generators to learn important features of real images and thus generate images with higher quality. The experiments demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed method, namely, Attention evolutionary GAN (AevoGAN) alleviates the training instability problems of CycleGAN training. In the test results, the proposed method can generate higher quality images and obtain better results than the CycleGAN training methods present in the literature, in terms of Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID).  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Sleep problems are common in spondyloarthritis (SpA), but the factors associated with them are only partially known. In this study, responses to item #16 from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society-Health Index (ASAS HI) that explores the sleep category according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) were compared between psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial SpA (axSpA). Methods: Post hoc analysis of a multicentre cross-sectional study included a total of 201 consecutive patients. The prevalence, correlations, and disease factors associated with a positive response to item #16 were analyzed in both SpA populations. Results: Forty-eight/111 (43.2%) patients with axSpA and 42/90 (46.7%) with PsA reported sleep problems. There was a moderate–high correlation between item #16 and the ASAS HI sum score in both populations (r ≥ .59). In axSpA, poor sleep was associated with disease activity (OR 8.45, p < .001), biological therapy use (OR .24, p < .05) and CRP levels (OR .16, p < .05). In PsA, disturbed sleep was independently associated with disease activity showing a dose-response effect (OR 1.16, p < .001). Taking both populations together, disease severity (OR 6.33, p < .001) and axSpA (OR .50, p < .05) were independently associated with a positive response to item #16. Correlations between the different components of the ASAS HI and item #16 were markedly different in both populations. Conclusions: A positive response to item #16 was common in both SpA phenotypes. However, the link between inflammatory burden and disturbed sleep was higher in axSpA than in PsA. © 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología},

	abstract = {Counterfactual explanation is a popular eXplainable AI technique, that gives contrastive explanations to answer potential "what-if"questions about the workings of machine learning models. However, research into how explanations are understood by human beings has shown that an optimal explanation should be both selected and social, providing multiple varying explanations for the same event that allow a user to select specific explanations based on prior beliefs and cognitive biases. In order to provide such explanations, a Rashomon set of explanations can be created: A set of explanations utilising different features in the data. Current work to generate counterfactual explanations does not take this need into account, only focusing on producing a single optimal counterfactual.This work presents a novel method for generating a diverse Rashomon set of counterfactual explanations using the final population from a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. It explores a selection of PSO niching algorithms for PSO and evaluates the best algorithm to produce these sets. Finally, the ability of this method to be implemented and trusted by users is discussed.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Objective/context: This article introduces debates on Nancy Cartwright’s concept of nomological machines applied to international relations theory. What the neo-neo synthesis claims as the essence of the international system is a set of conditions imposed upon international phenomena for the latter to fit into the theories themselves. It argues that the law-like explanations tailored by neorealism and neoliberalism are by no means a representation of the world as it is, but rather a predication of the world as these theories want it to be. Methodology: It critically reviews the foundations of neo-neo theories, suggesting a philosophical methodology by reframing the ontological terms of neorealism and neoliberalism based on the concept of nomological machines. Conclusions: This article contends that neo-neo theories could benefit from a capacities-oriented approach, which offers a less categorical understanding of how explanations of international phenomena are tailored, allowing alternative principles to provide invaluable insights about the international system. Originality: This paper innovates by intersecting the ideas of nomological machines with the metatheoretical debate on international relations, thus enabling theoretical improvement. © 2024 Universidad de los Andes, Colombia.

	abstract = {Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram data presents a burgeoning area of research, yet navigates through intricate optimization hurdles, alongside the persistent challenge of rendering results interpretable. In this study, we employed a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and utilized a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization and enhancing the model's performance and robustness in deciphering emotional states from EEG signals. Our methodology encompasses data pre-processing techniques, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, applied to EEG data for feature extraction and GA-driven hyperparameter optimization to identify an optimal neural network architecture. This architecture, consisting of Convolutional and Recurrent layers with dropout regularization, is adept at extracting temporal and spatial features from EEG signals while mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, we investigate explainable AI (XAI) strategies to get insight into the decision-making process of our GA-based optimized model. Additionally, rigorous cross-validation ensures the generalization performance of the optimized model across diverse datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with the optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieving an accuracy of 93.28% in classifying 24 different emotions. This study enhances our understanding of emotion recognition systems by examining the intricate interplay between EEG data analysis, CNN-LSTM networks, and Genetic Algorithm optimization. Additionally, it provides practical insights into the optimization of such systems, potentially influencing future advancements in affective computing technologies. © 2024 IEEE.},

However, precise control over melt pool geometry is crucial for ensuring high quality and performance. This study uses Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression techniques to manage melt pool geometry in AM processes. The primary goal is to evaluate these models' effectiveness in predicting and optimizing melt pool depth, width, and length using extensive datasets of process parameters and material properties. The models produced promising results. The best performance was for melt pool length, with an MSE of 0.0036, RMSE of 0.0600, MAE of 0.0300, and an R-squared score of 0.9456.

Accurate object identification and recognition is required for tasks such as autonomous navigation, video surveillance, precision agriculture, and medical imaging. We propose a method based on a unique combination of machine learning techniques for object recognition. The proposed approach starts by applying K-means segmentation to the input image to cluster similar regions and colors. Next, a composite saliency map is generated based on the K-means segmentation output. Subsequently, the technique of extracting objects from the saliency map is accomplished through the employment of the connected pixel object extraction method. Ultimately, the Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize decision tree classifier for the purpose of object recognition. The MSRC dataset was utilized to assess the proposed approach, resulting in an accuracy of 81.5%, accompanied by a precision of 83.3% and recall of 86.1%. The results depicts that the our approach is highly valuable for accurate object categorization, wherein the utilization of Genetic Algorithm significantly enhances the precision of the classification. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative condition requiring new therapeutic alternatives. Safinamide, a novel levodopa add-on therapy, positively affects disease fluctuations by modulating both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. To further investigate the use of safinamide in European routine clinical practice, the present post-hoc analysis aimed to understand safinamide’s safety profile within the Spanish study population. Patients and methods. Five hundred eleven Spanish patients with PD were evaluated at baseline, four (±1), eight (±1), and 12 (±1) months after initiating safinamide treatment. Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score and UPDRS part III score during on time were used to measure the overall severity of PD and motor complications, respectively, while the severity of adverse events was evaluated following the investigators’ criteria. Results. Safinamide showed a favourable safety profile within the Spanish study population, although prescription to patients with psychiatric conditions and off-label use were more frequent than in the European study population. In Spain, clinically meaningful improvements were observed in UPDRS scores when safinamide was used as the only add-on therapy to levodopa (57.4% and 53.7% of patients) and when switching from rasagiline (55.1% of patients). Motor complications were reduced from 83.2% to 63.3% after the study period. Increased safety concerns were undetected in any patient subgroup, although patients with cognitive impairment showed a slightly higher frequency of adverse events. Conclusions. This subanalysis further supports safinamide use as a safe and efficacious option for the management of motor fluctuations in different subgroups of levodopa-treated patients. However, safinamide should be used with caution in patients with cognitive impairment. © 2023 Revista de Neurología.},

	abstract = {There is a significant gap in Computing Education Research (CER) concerning the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) in advanced stages of degree programmes. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effectiveness of LLMs in answering exam questions within an applied machine learning final-year undergraduate course. The research examines the performance of LLMs in responding to a range of exam questions, including proctored closed-book and open-book questions spanning various levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Question formats encompassed open-ended, tabular data-based, and figure-based inquiries. To achieve this aim, the study has the following objectives: Comparative Analysis: To compare LLM-generated exam answers with actual student submissions to assess LLM performance. Detector Evaluation: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM detectors by directly inputting LLM-generated responses into these detectors. Additionally, assess detector performance on tampered LLM outputs designed to conceal their AI-generated origin. The research methodology used for this paper incorporates a staff-student partnership model involving eight academic staff and six students. Students play integral roles in shaping the project’s direction, particularly in areas unfamiliar to academic staff, such as specific tools to avoid LLM detection. This study contributes to the understanding of LLMs' role in advanced education settings, with implications for future curriculum design and assessment methodologies. © 2024 Universidad de Murcia.

A total of 789 adolescents (406 boys and 383 girls) between 11 and 17 years of age (M = 14.51, SD = 1.59) completed both the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-8) to assess eating disorder symptomatology and the Brief Version of the Young Schema Questionnaire for Adolescents and Young Adults (YSQ-3-B) to assess early maladaptive schemas. The results showed that girls had higher early maladaptive schema scores compared to boys, particularly for the disconnection and rejection domain, the impaired autonomy and performance domain, and the other-directedness domain, partially explaining their higher eating disorder symptom scores.

	abstract = {The accurate calibration of material parameters in crystal plasticity models is essential for applying crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Identifying these parameters usually requires unfeasible single-crystal experiments or expensive time costs due to the use of traditional genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. This study proposed an efficient and interpretable method for calibrating the constitutive parameters with macroscopic mechanical tests. This approach utilized the Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based surrogate-assisted GA (SGA) optimization method to identify a group of constitutive parameters that can reproduce the experimental stress–strain curve and crystallographic orientation by crystal plasticity simulation. The proposed approach was performed on the calibration of typical high-entropy alloy material parameters in two different CP models. The use of the surrogate model reduces the call count of simulation in the parameter searching process and speeds up the calibration significantly. With the help of infill sampling, the accuracy of this optimization method is consistent with the CP simulation and not limited by the accuracy of the surrogate model. Another merit of this method is that the pattern that the BNN surrogate found in the model parameters can be interpreted with its integrated gradients, which helps us to understand the relationship between constitutive parameters and the output mechanical response. The interpretation of BNN can guide further experiment design to decouple particular parameters and add constraints provided by the attached experiment or prior knowledge. © 2023 by the authors.},

In doing so, we review the validity of the expressive approach to partisanship and we test the biases that political identities can cause. Method: We use a strict measure based on a feeling thermometer regarding ordinary people depending on the party they vote for and their ideology and we pro-pose a formula to estimate the levels of difference in interpersonal political affect (DIPA). Subsequently, linear regression models were developed using data from a national representative sample survey conducted during the election campaign for the July 2023 general elections (n = 1,223). Results: Strong positive partisanship influences individual AP in a prominent way both when attitudes are expressed towards partisan or ideological groups. This contradicts the widespread discourse regarding the primacy of ideology in European multiparty systems. Moreover, we show that the overlapping between the-se two identities is not significant in explaining the phenomenon. Conclusion: AP is a group identity-based phenomenon even outside the U.S, which invites us to interpret it using the theories of social psychology. © 2024 Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.},

How to resolve the problem of extracting hidden features and correcting abnormal data is the key factor of improving mid-term prediction accuracy. This study proposes a mid-term PV forecasting system using the De-Trend First, Attend Next strategy. The prediction system employs the detrending before attending strategy. It first adopts and corrects abnormal time series data, and then reconstructs the corrected time series data into trend and seasonal components. After data is constructed, different models are applied to trend and seasonal data for separately predictions, and such predictions then be reconstructed into a realistic prediction result. To find hidden features and seasonal trends of seasonal components, we propose a new model. This model is constructed with an encoder–decoder structure temporal convolution, and attention mechanism. This study evaluates the prediction system using data from a photovoltaic power station in Australia. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a Coefficient of Determination value of 0.992, which represents a 73% improvement in the mean squared error index compared to the baseline model. In summary, the experiment result demonstrates that the system has a good capability of providing and predicting accurate data, which plays a significant role in power grid dispatch. © 2023},

	abstract = {Software testing represents a crucial component of software development, and it is usually making the difference between successful and failed projects. Although it is extremely important, due to the fast pace and short deadlines of contemporary projects it is often neglected or not detailed enough due to the lack of available time, leading to the potential loss of reputation, private users’ data, money, and even lives in some circumstances. In such situations, it would be vital to have the option to predict what modules are error-prone according to the collection of software metrics, and to focus testing on them, and that task is a typical classification task. Machine learning models have been frequently employed within a wide range of classification problems with significant success, and this paper proposes eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to execute the defect prediction task. A modified variant of the well-known reptile search optimization algorithm has been suggested to carry out the calibrating of the XGBoost hyperparameters. The enhanced algorithm was named HARSA and evaluated on the collection of challenging CEC2019 benchmark functions, where it exhibited excellent performance. Later, the introduced XGBoost model that uses the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two benchmark software testing datasets, and the simulation outcomes have been compared to other powerful swarm intelligence metaheuristics that were used in the identical experimental environment, where the proposed approach attained superior classification accuracy on both datasets. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was conducted to discover the impact of various software metrics on the classification results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study investigated the impact of war exposure on post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and sleep disturbance across Ukraine. Subjective and objective indicators of war exposure were modelled as predictors of these symptoms. Methods: We created two predictors: first, we used governmental and crowd-sourced data to create an objective war exposure index for each of the 21 non-occupied regions of Ukraine, based on the number of air raid alarms, explosions, and proximity to frontline; and second, we obtained self-report cross-sectional data, using convenience sampling, from a nation-wide survey (N = 991) on subjective experience of threat triggered by the war. The survey also measured the outcome variables of PTSS and sleep disturbance. Hierarchical multilevel regressions modelled the relationship of this objective war exposure index with the two outcome variables, after accounting for demographics. A final regression step modelled subjective threat as predictor of these symptoms. Results: We observed strongly elevated levels of PTSS and sleep disturbance and strong regional differences in objective and subjective war indicators. Objective war exposure predicted PTSS but not sleep disturbance, whereas subjective threat predicted both symptom domains. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of objective war exposure data for predicting the prevalence of PTSS in the different regions. The results further underscore the prominent role of subjective appraisal processes in the symptomatology of PTSS and sleep disturbance, thus informing theories on trauma-related disorders.

The framework is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO)-variational mode decomposition (VMD) combined with a time convolution network (TCN) embedded attention mechanism (Attention). The framework follows a two-step process. In the first step, PSO is applied to optimize the VMD decomposition method. The original electricity load sequence is decomposed, and the fitness function uses sample entropy to describe the complexity of the time series. The decomposed sub-sequences are combined with relevant features, such as meteorological data, to form the input sequence of the prediction model. In the second step, TCN is selected as the prediction model, and it is embedded with an attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy. The above input sequence is fed to the model to obtain the PSO-VMD-TCN-Attention prediction framework. Load datasets and various prediction models validate the PSO-optimized VMD decomposition method and the TCN-Attention prediction model. Simulation results demonstrate that the PSO-optimized VMD decomposition method enhances the model’s prediction accuracy, and the TCN-Attention prediction model outperforms other prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy and ability. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Recent stock market studies adopting machine learning and deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable performances with convenient accessibility. However, machine learning and deep learning models are notorious for their black-box structure. To build human-friendly interpretability in stock price prediction, many studies focus on the relationship between input features and the outcome by measuring the feature importance. However, the feature-importance-based interpretability methods have such drawbacks as relative feature importance, vague importance of correlated features, and impractical interpretability. Furthermore, they overlook two principal characteristics of time series stock price data: time-dependency and collective behavior of features. As a solution to catch the collective behavior of features over a whole data period, we propose the best feature subset selection. Additionally, for the solution to reflect the time-dependent characteristic of stock price data over a short data period, we propose piecewise best feature subset selection. The proposed algorithm uses two separate input feature sets: internal technical indicators and external market prices. This bilateral forecasting scheme goes through a two-stage feature selection process composed of feature set expansion, hybridized genetic algorithm-machine learning regressions to select important features, and importance score filtering to select optimal features. Finally, the best feature subset is selected for forecasting and interpretation. The proposed method achieves the best feature subset of parsimoniously fewer features for interpretability and improves average forecasting Root Mean Squared Error by 10.42% for the optimal feature set and 13.47% for the best feature subset of the internal technical indicators. For enhanced local interpretability in this study, we use Savitzky–Golay smoothing as part of piecewise optimal curve fitting to examine each potential grouping of external features. The proposed local interpretability technique using piecewise optimal curve fitting and piecewise best feature subset provides a more timely-flexible interpretation of stock price behavior using a few best features for piecewise data segments. Compared with other feature-importance interpretability techniques that only rely on either a single data point or a whole data period, the proposed interpretability technique overcomes their limitations, and reflects the main characteristics of time series data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The effects of newness to customer and innovation advantage on innovation success have been extensively researched from different perspectives, especially in a B2C context. However, the joint influence of these two determinants has hardly been studied. This paper uses the theoretical framework of customer perceived value to explain the main effects of newness to customer and innovation advantage, as well as their interaction, on the financial and non-financial dimensions of innovation success in a B2B context. Data were collected through a telephone survey of a sample of 170 Spanish companies with up to three informants. To validate the measurement model, a confirmatory factor analysis was carried out, and for hypothesis testing, a hierarchical multiple regression, with a subsequent estimation of moderation using STATA’s margins command. The results confirmed the predictions of the theoretical framework of customer perceived value for the financial performance of innovation, but not for the non-financial performance. © (2023), (Universidad Pablo de Olavide).

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, as it can slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Machine learning has shown promise in AD detection using various medical modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level stacking model that combines heterogeneous models and modalities to predict different classes of AD. The modalities include cognitive sub-scores (e.g., clinical dementia rating - sum of boxes, Alzheimer's disease assessment scale) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. In the proposed approach, in level 1, we used six base models (Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Native Bayes (NB)to train each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA). Then, we build stacking training that combines the outputs of each base model for the training set and staking testing that combines the outcomes of each model for the testing set. In level 2, three stacking models are produced for each modality that trains and evaluates based on the output of 6 base models based on (RF, LR, DT, SVM, KNN, and NB) are combined in training stacking for the training set and testing stacking for the testing set. Stacking training is used to train meta-learners (RF), and stacking testing is used to evaluate meta-learners (RF). Finally, in level 3, the output prediction of the stacking model from each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA) in the training and testing datasets is merged to build a new dataset, which is staking training and stacking testing. Training stacking is used to train the meta-learner, and the testing set is used to evaluate the meta-learner and produce the final prediction. Our research also aims to provide model explanations, ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, and trust through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Feature selection optimization based on Particle Swarm Optimization is used to select the most appropriate sub-scores. The proposed model shows significant potential for improving early disease diagnosis. The results demonstrate that the multi-modality approach outperforms single-modality approaches. Moreover, the proposed multi-level stacking models achieve the highest performance with selected features compared to regular ML classifiers and stacking models using full multi-modalities, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 92.08%, 92.07%, 92.08%, and 92.01% for two classes, and 90.03%, 90.19%, 90.03%, and 90.05% for three classes, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Users of residential complexes in Tehran city are evaluated as a research society. The research method in the present study will be of mixed type and its performance method will be based on the survey. The results show that the spatial organization in residential complexes in Tehran city is based on the flexibility of the kitchen, living, dining, catering, and bedroom spaces. Accordingly, the most flexible features take place between them, which has led to the increased flexibility of spaces in relation to various activities. However, other spaces are just a place to do a specific activity, which confirms the reduction of their flexibility. © 2022, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy (RP) is an adverse event with high impact on patient's quality of life. Nowadays there is no standardized method for urinary continence measurement. Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction (PRR) is a surgical step that can improve early urinary continence after RP. Our objective was to analyse different continence definitions and predictors of urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted RP (RARP). Materials and methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (NCT03302169) including 152 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer subjected to RARP. Patients were randomised to single urethrovesical anastomosis (control arm) or PRR before urethrovesical anastomosis (PRR arm). Urinary continence was measured with the EPIC-26 and ICIQ-SF validated questionnaires, and pad use (0-1 pads and no pads), at 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days after catheter removal. Prognostic factors for early urinary continence recovery were analysed. Results: 72 patients were included in the control arm and 80 in the PRR arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms, except body mass index, which was higher in PRR arm. “No pad” was the only definition assessing the benefit of PRR at 30 days, 33.8% in PRR arm and 18.1% in control arm, p = 0.022; and at 90 days, 58.8 and 43.1% respectively, p = 0.038. Questionnaires did not detect differences in terms of continence recovery. PRR was the only predictor for early continence recovery, p = 0.03. Conclusions: PRR increased early urinary continence recovery after RARP. Continence definition was critical to assess benefit. The only predictive factor for early continence recovery was PRR. © 2022 AEU},

	abstract = {In Amazonian terra-firme non inundated forests, local floristic composition and species occurrence are explained by water availability as determined by topographic conditions. Topographic complexity can render these conditions quite variable across the landscape and the effects on plant ecological responses are difficult to document. We used a set of topographically defined hydrological metrics to evaluate community composition and single-species responses of four plant groups [pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes), Melastomataceae, palms (Arecaceae) and Zingiberales] to topographic conditions in the middle Juruá River region, in western Brazilian Amazonia. The area spans two geological formations (Içá and Solimões) with contrasting topography. River terraces are also found along the main rivers in the area. Local topographic conditions were approximated by height above the nearest drainage (HAND), slope, and Strahler´s drainage order, all obtained from a SRTM digital elevation model (DEM). Data were analyzed using linear and generalized linear mixed models and regression trees. HAND was most successful in explaining floristic composition for all plant groups, except for Melastomataceae, and was more important in the hilly Içá formation than in the Solimões. Individual occurrences of 57% species were predicted by at least one of the topographic variables, suggesting a marked habitat specialization along topographic gradients. For these species, response models using SRTM-DEM-derived variables gave similar results than models using field-measured topography only. Our results suggest that topographical variables estimated from remote sensing can be used to predict local variation in the structure of plant communities in tropical forests. © 2022, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

	abstract = {Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (Io), 5G networks, and cloud computing (CC) have led to the development of Human-centric IoT (HIoT) applications that transform human physical monitoring based on machine monitoring. The HIoT systems find use in several applications such as smart cities, healthcare, transportation, etc. Besides, the HIoT system and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools can be deployed in the healthcare sector for effective decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue that necessitates automated and effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at the initial stage. This article presents a new quantum-inspired differential evolution with explainable artificial intelligence based COVID-19 Detection and Classification (QIDEXAI-CDC) model for HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model aims to identify the occurrence of COVID-19 using the XAI tools on HIoT systems. The QIDEXAI-CDC model primarily uses bilateral filtering (BF) as a preprocessing tool to eradicate the noise. In addition, RetinaNet is applied for the generation of useful feature vectors from radiological images. For COVID-19 detection and classification, quantum-inspired differential evolution (QIDE) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model is utilized. The utilization of the QIDE algorithm helps to appropriately choose the weight and bias values of the KELM model. In order to report the enhanced COVID-19 detection outcomes of the QIDEXAI-CDC model, a wide range of simulations was carried out. Extensive comparative studies reported the supremacy of the QIDEXAI-CDC model over the recent approaches. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {High-precision permeability prediction is of great significance to tight sandstone reservoirs. However, while considerable progress has recently been made in the machine learning based prediction of reservoir permeability, the generalization of this approach is limited by weak interpretability. Hence, an interpretable XGBoost model is proposed herein based on particle swarm optimization to predict the permeability of tight sandstone reservoirs with higher accuracy and robust interpretability. The porosity and permeability of 202 core plugs and 6 logging curves (namely, the gamma-ray (GR) curve, the acoustic curve (AC), the spontaneous potential (SP) curve, the caliper (CAL) curve, the deep lateral resistivity (RILD) curve, and eight lateral resistivity (RFOC) curve) are extracted along with three derived variables (i.e., the shale content, the AC slope, and the GR slope) as data sets. Based on the data preprocessing, global and local interpretations are performed according to the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, and the redundant features in the data set are screened to identify the porosity, AC, CAL, and GR slope as the four most important features. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is then used to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model. The prediction results of the PSO-XGBoost model indicate a superior performance compared with that of the benchmark XGBoost model. In addition, the reliable application of the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model in the prediction of tight sandstone reservoir permeability is examined by comparing the results with those of two traditional mathematical regression models, five machine learning models, and three deep learning models. Thus, the interpretable PSO-XGBoost model is shown to have more advantages in permeability prediction along with the lowest root mean square error, thereby confirming the effectiveness and practicability of this method.  © 2022 Jing-Jing Liu and Jian-Chao Liu.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In this article, we propose a query-and-learn active learning approach combined with first-principles calculations to rapidly search for potentially stable crystal structure via elemental substitution, to clarify their stabilization mechanism, and integrate this approach to SmFe12-based compounds with ThMn12 structure, which exhibits prominent magnetic properties. The proposed method aims to (1) accurately estimate formation energies with limited first-principles calculation data, (2) visually monitor the progress of the structure search process, (3) extract correlations between structures and formation energies, and (4) recommend the most beneficial candidates of SmFe12-substituted structures for the subsequent first-principles calculations. The structures of SmFe12 - α - βXαYβ before optimization are prepared by substituting X, Y elements—Mo, Zn, Co, Cu, Ti, Al, Ga—in the region of α + β < 4 into iron sites of the original SmFe12 structures. Using the optimized structures and formation energies obtained from the first-principles calculations after each active learning cycle, we construct an embedded two-dimensional space to rationally visualize the set of all the calculated and not-yet-calculated structures for monitoring the progress of the search. Our machine learning model with an embedding representation attained a prediction error for the formation energy of 1.25 × 10 - 2 (eV/atom) and required only one-sixth of the training data compared to other learning methods. Moreover, the time required to recall most potentially stable structures was nearly four times faster than the random search. The formation energy landscape visualized using the embedding representation revealed that the substitutions of Al and Ga have the highest potential to stabilize the SmFe12 structure. In particular, SmFe9[Al/Ga]2Ti showed the highest stability among the investigated structures. Finally, by quantitatively measuring the change in the structures before and after optimization using OFM descriptors, the correlations between the coordination number of substitution sites and the resulting formation energy are revealed. The negative-formation-energy-family SmFe12 - α - β[Al/Ga]αYβ structures show a common trend of increasing coordination number at substituted sites, whereas structures with positive formation energy show a corresponding decreasing trend. Impact statement: Seeking the next generation of high-performance magnets is a crucial demand for replacing the widely accepted Nd-Fe-B magnets developed in the middle 80s. The iron-rich compounds with the original tetragonal ThMn12 structure appear as the most potential candidates except for the hard synthesizing it in nature due to its high energy of formation. Stabilization for this material system is expected by substituting new elements, but the vast number of possible structures makes the exploration difficult even for theoretical calculations. This article proposes an integration of first-principles calculations and explainable active learning to efficiently explore the crystal structure space of this material system. In particular, the explored crystal structure space can be rationally visualized, on which the relationship between substitution elements, substitution sites, and crystal structure stabilization can be intuitively interpreted. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Judicialization scholarship suggests that states must seek the de-judicialization of international dispute settlement mechanisms to regain regulatory space. Why then do some states seek a de-judicialization yet others increased judicialization of dispute settlement mechanisms in their pursuit of regulatory space? This article advances a twofold argument. First, the concept of judicialization has been erroneously conflated with state perceptions of regulatory space under dispute settlement mechanisms. States aspiring to consolidate regulatory space may pursue de-judicialization and increased judicialization alike. Second, states' preferences for de-judicialization or increased judicialization to regain regulatory space should largely depend on conceptions of legitimate international law as either intergovernmental contracts or cosmopolitan quasi-constitutional order. The article illustrates these arguments at the example of US and EU efforts to reform the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization and investor-to-state dispute settlement. Both seek to increase regulatory space. Yet, the USA pursues de-judicialization while the EU promotes judicialization. © 2021 The Author.

	abstract = {The need for accurate time-series results is badly demanding. LSTM has been applied for forecasting time series, which is generated when variables are observed at discrete and equal time intervals. Nevertheless, the problem of determining hyperparameters with a relatively high random rate will reduce the accuracy of the prediction results. This paper aims to promote LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism. PSO optimizes LSTM hyperparameters, and Bifold-attention mechanism selects the optimal input for LSTM. An accurate, adaptive, and robust time-series forecasting model is the main contribution, compared with ARIMA, MLP, LSTM, PSO-LSTM, A-LSTM, and PSO-A-LSTM. The model comparison is based on the accuracy of each model in forecasting Beijing PM2.5, Beijing Multi-Site, Air Quality, Appliances Energy, Wind Speed, and Traffic Flow. The Proposed model, LSTM with tuned-PSO and Bifold-Attention mechanism, has lower MAPE and RMSE than baselines. In other words, the model outperformed all LSTM base models in this study. The proposed model's accuracy is adaptable in daily, weekly, and monthly multivariate time-series datasets. This ground-breaking innovation is valuable for time-series analysis research, particularly the implementation of deep learning for time-series forecasting. © 2013 IEEE.},

Secondly, I will discuss the main characteristics of this affective disposition.

	abstract = {Since 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly worldwide, posing an unignorable threat to the global economy and human health. It is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus. This virus is highly infectious and relies on its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-receptor to enter cells. With the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, the difficulty of diagnosis due to the lack of global healthcare resources becomes increasingly apparent. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis models with high generalisability can effectively alleviate this pressure. Hyperparameter tuning is essential in training such models and significantly impacts their final performance and training speed. However, traditional hyperparameter tuning methods are usually time-consuming and unstable. To solve this issue, we introduce Particle Swarm Optimisation to build a PSO-guided Self-Tuning Convolution Neural Network (PSTCNN), allowing the model to tune hyperparameters automatically. Therefore, the proposed approach can reduce human involvement. Also, the optimisation algorithm can select the combination of hyperparameters in a targeted manner, thus stably achieving a solution closer to the global optimum. Experimentally, the PSTCNN can obtain quite excellent results, with a sensitivity of 93.65% ± 1.86%, a specificity of 94.32% ± 2.07%, a precision of 94.30% ± 2.04%, an accuracy of 93.99% ± 1.78%, an F1-score of 93.97% ± 1.78%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 87.99% ± 3.56%, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 93.97% ± 1.78%. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, hyperparameter tuning of the model using an optimisation algorithm is faster and more effective. © 2023 Centro Regional de Invest.

We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length. Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice.

In this Hypothesis, we propose that a possible explanation for the origin of megakaryocytes and platelets is that, ∼220 million years ago, an inheritable change occurred in a mammalian ancestor that caused the haemostatic cell line of the animal to become polyploid. This inheritable change occurred specifically in the genetic programme of the cell lineage from which the haemostatic cell originated and led, because of increase in cell size, to its fragmentation into cytoplasmic particles (platelets) in the pulmonary circulatory system, as found in modern mammals. We hypothesize that these fragments originating from the new large haemostatic polyploid cells proved to be more efficient at stopping bleeding, and, therefore, the progeny of this ancestor prospered through natural selection. We also propose experimental strategies that could provide evidence to support this hypothesis. © 2022 Company of Biologists Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It aims to explain what was behind the use of escalated force by the Spanish law enforcement agencies against the 15-M Movement. Although the Indignados’ goals were not undemocratic, they were treated and fought by the law enforcement agencies precisely as criminals threatening democracy, Spain, and Spaniards. The major argument is that treating the protest movement as the enemy that had to be suppressed might have been a defense mechanism of militant democracy. Transforming the Indignados into the enemy might have resulted from fears of threatening the existing status quo and losing political elites’ own state positions. © 2022 Schedes.

The PSO brings in a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying out multi-objective optimization in large dimensions, capability for multiple CF generation, and setting box constraints or immutability of data attributes. An algorithm is proposed that incorporates these features and it enables greater control over the proximity and sparsity properties over the generated CFs.

However, its interpretability has been lacking of concrete research. Improving the stability of the feature selection method is a way to effectively improve its interpretability. A novel feature selection approach named Interpretable Particle Swarm Optimization is developed in this paper. It uses four data perturbation ways and three filter feature selection methods to obtain stable feature subsets, and adopts Fuch map to convert them to initial particles. Besides, it employs similarity mutation strategy, which applies Tanimoto distance to choose the nearest 1/3 individuals to the previous particles to implement mutation. Eleven representative algorithms and four typical datasets are taken to make a comprehensive comparison with our proposed approach. Accuracy, F1, precision and recall rate indicators are used as classification measures, and extension of Kuncheva indicator is employed as the stability measure. Experiments show that our method has a better interpretability than the compared evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, the results of classification measures demonstrate that the proposed approach has an excellent comprehensive classification performance. © 2022 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

	abstract = {Respecting and protecting all parties have always been the objective of every criminal proceeding, aiming to achieve justice at every stage of the criminal trial. This protection becomes of utmost importance when dealing with victims who have suffered injuries because of crime. For this reason, both India and Ukraine have given special protection to victims’ rights throughout the criminal process. This paper aims to analyze the role and degree of protection offered by these criminal procedure codes in respecting the rights of victims. Despite all the procedures put in place, the condition of the victim is still questionable, which has considerably affected the credibility of these countries’ criminal procedure codes. To determine whether they really ensure the respect of victims’ rights, a comparative methodology was used to establish the expectations of the two criminal law systems in this matter. The findings suggest that even though the criminal procedure codes of both countries have relevant provisions to protect the victims’ rights, their criminal procedure systems are still marred with issues regarding this aspect. Consequently, there is a need to revisit these codes to ensure that the rights of parties, especially those of the victims, are respected. © 2022, Universidad Catolica de Colombia.

Written vocabulary tests have long been used to measure L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge in studies on listening comprehension, while a limited number of studies have investigated the role of aural vocabulary knowledge to explain success in L2 listening. The current study adopts an aural receptive vocabulary test to measure L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge and a listening task to measure their L2 listening comprehension proficiency. The results show that L2 learners’ aural vocabulary knowledge significantly correlates with their listening proficiency. Although learners’ aural word knowledge at each frequency level (from 1K to 5K) and their academic word knowledge were significantly correlated with L2 listening, the strongest correlation was between academic vocabulary knowledge and listening, followed by that between word knowledge at the 5K frequency level and listening. In terms of the contribution of aural vocabulary knowledge to L2 listening, the scores achieved for the academic word knowledge measure alone explain 22% of the variance in L2 listening, and the scores achieved for the 5K word frequency level measure alone explain 16.7% of such variance. Learners’ academic vocabulary knowledge is found to explain unique variance over and above their vocabulary knowledge at the 5K word frequency level in L2 listening. © 2023 Universitat de Lleida.

	abstract = {The fairness characteristic is a critical attribute of trusted AI systems. A plethora of research has proposed diverse methods for individual fairness testing. However, they are suffering from three major limitations, i.e., low efficiency, low effectiveness, and model-specificity. This work proposes ExpGA, an explanation-guided fairness testing approach through a genetic algorithm (GA). ExpGA employs the explanation results generated by interpretable methods to collect high-quality initial seeds, which are prone to derive discriminatory samples by slightly modifying feature values. ExpGA then adopts GA to search discriminatory sample candidates by optimizing a fitness value. Benefiting from this combination of explanation results and GA, ExpGA is both efficient and effective to detect discriminatory individuals. Moreover, ExpGA only requires prediction probabilities of the tested model, resulting in a better generalization capability to various models. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets, show that ExpGA presents higher efficiency and effectiveness than four state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Background: In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease, percutaneous coronary intervention for non-culprit lesions is superior to treatment of the culprit lesion alone. The optimal timing for non-infarct-related artery revascularization – immediate versus staged – has not been investigated adequately. Aim: We aimed to assess clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease using immediate versus staged non-infarct-related artery revascularization. Methods: Outcomes were analysed in patients from the randomized FLOWER-MI trial, in whom, after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention, non-culprit lesions were assessed using fractional flow reserve or angiography during the index procedure or during a staged procedure during the initial hospital stay, ≤ 5 days after the index procedure. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and unplanned hospitalization with urgent revascularization at 1 year. Results: Among 1171 patients enrolled in this study, 1119 (96.2%) had complete revascularization performed during a staged procedure, and 44 (3.8%) at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention. During follow-up, a primary outcome event occurred in one of the patients (2.3%) with an immediate strategy and in 55 patients (4.9%) with a staged strategy (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.39–12.69; P = 0.64). Conclusions: Staged non-infarct-related artery complete revascularization was the strategy preferred by investigators in practice in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with multivessel disease. This strategy was not superior to immediate revascularization, which, in the context of this trial, was used in a small proportion of patients. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these observational findings. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

This article assesses their role in the EU’s system of differentiated integration. To that end, it advances a model based on rational choice theory, outlining the steps and conditions under which tolerated arrangements of de facto differentiation can emerge. This is illustrated in three case studies in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): (1) Sweden’s de facto opt-out from EMU; (2) Kosovo’s adoption of the euro as sole legal tender, and (3) the Fiscal Compact. Data was gathered via document analysis and 11 expert interviews. The article concludes that de facto differentiation may constitute a viable alternative and useful means to make EU integration more flexible if strong national demand for differentiation meets the need for discretion or timely, pragmatic action. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Seizure prediction might be the solution to tackle the apparent unpredictability of seizures in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, which comprise about a third of all patients with epilepsy. Designing seizure prediction models involves defining the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between inter-ictal brain activity and the seizure discharge. This period is typically a fixed interval, with some recent studies reporting the evaluation of different patient-specific pre-ictal intervals. Recently, researchers have aimed to determine the pre-ictal period, a transition stage between regular brain activity and a seizure. Authors have been using deep learning models given the ability of such models to automatically perform pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and handling temporal and spatial dependencies. As these approaches create black-box models, clinicians may not have sufficient trust to use them in high-stake decisions. By considering these problems, we developed an evolutionary seizure prediction model that identifies the best set of features while automatically searching for the pre-ictal period and accounting for patient comfort. This methodology provides patient-specific interpretable insights, which might contribute to a better understanding of seizure generation processes and explain the algorithm’s decisions. We tested our methodology on 238 seizures and 3687 h of continuous data, recorded on scalp recordings from 93 patients with several types of focal and generalised epilepsies. We compared the results with a seizure surrogate predictor and obtained a performance above chance for 32% patients. We also compared our results with a control method based on the standard machine learning pipeline (pre-processing, feature extraction, classifier training, and post-processing), where the control marginally outperformed our approach by validating 35% of the patients. In total, 54 patients performed above chance for at least one method: our methodology or the control one. Of these 54 patients, 21 (≈ 38%) were solely validated by our methodology, while 24 (≈ 44%) were only validated by the control method. These findings may evidence the need for different methodologies concerning different patients. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been widely applied to ship detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Unlike optical images, the current object detection methods have the problem of weak feature representation due to the low object resolution in SAR images. In addition, disturbed by chaotic noise, the features of classification and location are prone to significant differences, resulting in classification and location task misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel SAR ship target detection algorithm based on Cross-Attention Mechanism (CAM), which can establish the information interaction between the classification and localization task and strengthen the correlation between features through attention. In addition, to suppress the noise in multi-scale feature fusion, we designed an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module (AFFM), which uses the attention information between channels to perform the re-weighting operation. This operation can enhance useful feature information and suppress noise information. Experimental results show that on a benchmark SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), the Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone network was optimized to improve AP by 6.5% and computational cost by 0.51%. RetinaNet with ResNet-50 backbone network was optimized to improve AP by 1.8% and computational cost by 0.51%. ©, Copyright © CASI.},

	abstract = {Metaheuristics are crucial for solving complex optimization problems effectively in many fields. With the recent increased interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the issue of how metaheuristics interact with XAI has attracted much attention. Most metaheuristics have stochastic search processes, and the jaguar algorithm (JA) is a unique algorithm that has exact search paths. JA shows potential abilities both in exploration and exploitation, but still faces limitations. Therefore, this study proposes a new metaheuristic based on JA and invents precision hunting behavior (PH-JA), which inherits the concept of JA and significantly strengthens its search efficiency. PH-JA improves the solution quality by adaptively detecting the current environment's trends during movement and precisely hunting prey. Then, PH-JA makes the best of the historical information to reduce the computational cost. PH-JA is an explainable metaheuristic and has systematic operational procedures in that each movement is performed according to the present situation rather than random elements. Therefore, the path to a solution is interpretable and can return the same result with the same input. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of PH-JA, which is better than other classical and state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and evaluation costs.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Importance: De-escalation of dual-antiplatelet therapy through dose reduction of prasugrel improved net adverse clinical events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), mainly through the reduction of bleeding without an increase in ischemic outcomes. However, whether such benefits are similarly observed in those receiving complex procedures is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the benefits of prasugrel dose de-escalation therapy are maintained in the complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) subgroup. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a post hoc analysis of the HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS trial, a randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, multicenter trial performed at 35 hospitals in South Korea. Study participants included patients with ACS who were receiving PCI. Data were collected from September 30, 2014, to December 18, 2015, and analyzed from September 17, 2020, to June 15, 2021. Interventions and Exposures: Patients were randomized to a prasugrel dose de-escalation (5 mg daily) at 1 month post-PCI group or a conventional (10 mg daily) group. Complex PCI was defined as having at least 1 of the following features: 3 or more stents implanted, 3 or more lesions treated, bifurcation PCI, total stent length 60 mm or larger, left main PCI, or heavy calcification. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main analysis end points were MACE (major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and repeat revascularization) at 1 year for ischemic outcomes, and BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) class 2 or higher bleeding events at 1 year for bleeding outcomes. Results: Of 2271 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [9.0] years; 2024 [89%] male patients) for whom full procedural data were available, 705 patients received complex PCI, and 1566 patients received noncomplex PCI. Complex PCI was associated with higher rates of ischemic outcomes but not with bleeding outcomes. Prasugrel dose de-escalation did not increase the risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.47-1.66; P =.70 in complex PCI; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.45-1.46; P =.48 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.84) but decreased BARC class 2 or higher bleeding events (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.61; P =.002 in complex PCI; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.00; P =.05 in noncomplex PCI; P for interaction =.08), albeit with wide 95% CIs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this post hoc analysis of patients with ACS, prasugrel dose de-escalation compared with conventional therapy was not associated with an increased risk of ischemic outcomes but may reduce the risk of minor bleeding events at 1 year, irrespective of PCI complexity.

	abstract = {When dealing with high-dimensional data, such as in biometric, e-commerce, or industrial applications, it is extremely hard to capture the abnormalities in full space due to the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly complicated but essential to provide interpretations for outlier detection results in high-dimensional space as a consequence of the large number of features. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new model based on a Variational AutoEncoder and Genetic Algorithm (VAEGA) for detecting outliers in subspaces of high-dimensional data. The proposed model employs a neural network to create a probabilistic dimensionality reduction variational autoencoder (VAE) that applies its low-dimensional hidden space to characterize the high-dimensional inputs. Then, the hidden vector is sampled randomly from the hidden space to reconstruct the data so that it closely matches the input data. The reconstruction error is then computed to determine an outlier score, and samples exceeding the threshold are tentatively identified as outliers. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a basis for examining and analyzing the abnormal subspace of the outlier set obtained by the VAE layer. After encoding the outlier dataset’s subspaces, the degree of anomaly for the detected subspaces is calculated using the redefined fitness function. Finally, the abnormal subspace is calculated for the detected point by selecting the subspace with the highest degree of anomaly. The clustering of abnormal subspaces helps filter outliers that are mislabeled (false positives), and the VAE layer adjusts the network weights based on the false positives. When compared to other methods using five public datasets, the VAEGA outlier detection model results are highly interpretable and outperform or have competitive performance compared to current contemporary methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

The research was based on two-year hourly data concentrations of inorganic gaseous pollutants, particulate matter, benzene, toluene, m, p-xylenes, total nonmethane hydrocarbons, and meteorological parameters obtained from the Global Data Assimilation System. In order to determine the model that will be capable of achieving a superior level of performance, eight metaheuristics algorithms were tested for eXtreme Gradient Boosting optimization, while the relative SHapley Additive exPlanations values were used to estimate the relative importance of each pollutant level and meteorological parameter for the prediction of benzene concentrations. According to the results, benzene levels are mostly shaped by toluene and the finest aerosol fraction concentrations, in the environment governed by temperature, volumetric soil moisture content, and momentum flux direction, as well as by levels of total nonmethane hydrocarbons and total nitrogen oxide. The types of conditions which provided the environment for the impact of toluene, the finest aerosol, and temperature on benzene dynamics are distinguished and described. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The installed capacity of photovoltaic power generation occupies an increasing proportion in the power system, and its stability is greatly affected by the fluctuation of solar radiation. Accurate prediction of solar radiation is an important prerequisite for ensuring power grid security and electricity market transactions. The current mainstream solar radiation prediction method is the deep learning method, and the structure design and data selection of the deep learning method determine the prediction accuracy and speed of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) model based on the attention mechanism and genetic algorithm (AGA-LSTM). The attention mechanism is used to assign different weights to each feature, so that the model can focus more attention on the key features. Meanwhile, the structure and data selection parameters of the model are optimized through genetic algorithms, and the time series memory and processing capabilities of LSTM are used to predict the global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance after 5, 10, and 15 min. The proposed AGA-LSTM model was trained and tested with two years of data from the public database Solar Radiation Research Laboratory site of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The experimental results show that under the three prediction scales, the prediction performance of the AGA-LSTM model is below 20%, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy compared with the continuous model and some public methods. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction (DR) is an important technique for data exploration and knowledge discovery. However, most of the main DR methods are either linear (e.g., PCA), do not provide an explicit mapping between the original data and its lower-dimensional representation (e.g., MDS, t-SNE, isomap), or produce mappings that cannot be easily interpreted (e.g., kernel PCA, neural-based autoencoder). Recently genetic programming (GP) has been used to evolve interpretable DR mappings in the form of symbolic expressions. There exists a number of ways in which GP can be used to this end and no study exists that performs a comparison. In this paper, we fill this gap by comparing existing GP methods as well as devising new ones. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark datasets based on predictive accuracy and on how well the original features can be reconstructed using the lower-dimensional representation only. Finally we qualitatively assess the resulting expressions and their complexity. We find that various GP methods can be competitive with state-of-the-art DR algorithms and that they have the potential to produce interpretable DR mappings.  © 2022 ACM.},

Nevertheless, interpreting complex opaque models is not trivial. Current interpretability approaches rely on local explanations or produce long explanations that tend to overload the user's cognitive abilities. In this paper, we address this problem by extracting interpretable, transparent models from opaque ones via a new readability-enhanced multi-objective Genetic Programming approach called REMO-GP. To achieve that, we adapt text readability metrics into model complexity proxies that support evaluating ML interpretability. We demonstrate that our approach can generate global interpretable models that mimic the decisions of complex opaque models over several datasets, while keeping model complexity low. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human lives are increasingly influenced by algorithms, which therefore need to meet higher standards not only in accuracy but also with respect to explainability. This is especially true for high-stakes areas such as real estate valuation. Unfortunately, the methods applied there often exhibit a trade-off between accuracy and explainability. One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision is supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting in accuracy. The unexplainable machine learning approaches are often observed to provide higher accuracy but are not scrutable in their decision-making. In this paper, we apply evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to CBR predictors in order to improve their performance. In particular, we deploy EAs to the similarity functions (used in CBR to find comparable cases), which are fitted to the data set at hand. As a consequence, we achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), while keeping interpretability and explainability. These results stem from our empirical evaluation on a large data set of real estate offers where we compare known similarity functions, their EA-improved counterparts, and DNNs. Surprisingly, DNNs are only on par with standard CBR techniques. However, using EA-learned similarity functions does yield an improved performance.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Background: Psoriasis has important physical and psychosocial effects that extend beyond the skin. Understanding the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-perceived symptom severity in psoriasis is key to clinical decision-making. Objectives: This post hoc analysis of the PSO-LONG trial data assessed the impact of long-term proactive or reactive management with fixed-dose combination calcipotriene 50 µg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g (Cal/BD) foam on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: Five hundred and twenty-one patients from the Phase 3, randomized, double-blind PSO-LONG trial were included. An initial 4-week, open-label phase of fixed-dose combination Cal/BD foam once daily (QD) was followed by a 52-week maintenance phase, at the start of which patients were randomized to a proactive management arm (Cal/BD foam twice weekly) or reactive management arm (vehicle foam twice weekly). Patient-perceived symptom severity and HRQoL were assessed using the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the EuroQol-5D for psoriasis (EQ-5D-5L-PSO). Results: Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed across all PRO measures. The mean difference (standard deviation) from baseline to Week 4 was −8.97 (6.18) for PSI, −6.02 (5.46) for DLQI and 0.11 (0.15) for EQ-5D-5L-PSO scores. During maintenance, patients receiving reactive management had significantly higher DLQI (15% [p = 0.007]) and PSI (15% [p = 0.0128]) and a numerically lower EQ-5D-5L-PSO mean area under the curve score than patients receiving proactive management (1% [p = 0.0842]). Conclusions: Cal/BD foam significantly improved DLQI, EQ-5D-5L-PSO and PSI scores during the open-label and maintenance phases. Patients assigned to proactive management had significantly better DLQI and PSI scores and numerically better EQ-5D-5L-PSO versus reactive management. Additionally, baseline flare was associated with worse PROs than the start of a relapse, and patients starting a relapse also had worse PROs than patients in remission. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study explores the relative importance of two types of knowledge – vocabulary and grammar – to explain success for L2 learners’ listening comprehension (LC). Forty Chinese learners of English studying in a UK university participated in the study. L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge was measured through a receptive aural vocabulary test and their grammar knowledge was measured through an aural grammar test. The Cambridge Preliminary English Test (PET) listening section was adopted to measure L2 learners’ listening comprehension proficiency. Results from correlation analysis showed that both vocabulary and grammar measures correlated with L2 listening (r =.65 and r =.74, respectively). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the vocabulary and grammar measures jointly explained 65.7% of the variance in the listening score and that each measure made a unique contribution. It was also found that the grammar measure explained more of the variance in L2 listening than the vocabulary measure. These results demonstrate the importance of good L2 vocabulary and grammar knowledge in benefiting learners’ LC. © 2023, Universidad de Granada. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Joint damage in haemophilia often requires surgical correction. However, the surgery effect on bleeding rates and other clinical joint outcomes can be unclear. Aim: To investigate the effects of joint surgery on joint annualized bleeding rates (JABRs) and physical health outcomes in patients with haemophilia A undergoing N8-GP prophylaxis. Methods: Patients in the pathfinder 2 trial received N8-GP prophylaxis, enrolling in the pathfinder 3 trial for indicated surgery. Patients returned to pathfinder 2 post-surgery, continuing N8-GP prophylaxis until end-of-trial. JABRs were calculated from bleeding across all joints for pre-surgery (immediately before surgery) and post-surgery (to pathfinder 2 study end) periods. Joint-health-related outcomes were derived from patient records. Results: Data (41 joint surgeries; n = 30) were analysed statistically using datamining and descriptively. Pre-surgery mean JABR was higher in patients who later were operated than in 146 non-operated patients (p =.004). In operated patients, mean JABR decreased from 1.33 pre-surgery to.37 post-surgery (p =.011). In all but three patients, JABR improved or remained the same post-surgery. In the three patients whose JABR remained at one (all with multiple joint arthropathy), post-surgery bleeds were mostly at non-operated sites. Two of the three patients whose JABR increased post-surgery had undergone surgery for reasons unlikely to improve JABR. Mobility parameters often improved in patients whose JABR remained at zero. Conclusion: Patients with haemophilia treated with N8-GP prophylaxis benefit from surgeries. However, this analysis could not differentiate the relative contributions of surgical interventions and prophylactic treatment to the improvement of JABR. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {In the past decade, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has attracted a great interest in the research community, motivated by the need for explanations in critical AI applications. Some recent advances in XAI are based on Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques, such as Genetic Programming. We call this trend EC for XAI. We argue that the full potential of EC methods has not been fully exploited yet in XAI, and call the community for future efforts in this field. Likewise, we find that there is a growing concern in EC regarding the explanation of population-based methods, i.e., their search process and outcomes. While some attempts have been done in this direction (although, in most cases, those are not explicitly put in the context of XAI), we believe that there are still several research opportunities and open research questions that, in principle, may promote a safer and broader adoption of EC in real-world applications. We call this trend XAI within EC. In this position paper, we briefly overview the main results in the two above trends, and suggest that the EC community may play a major role in the achievement of XAI. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Background: ERVEBO®, a live recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine containing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) in place of the VSV GP (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP), was advanced through clinical development by Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA in collaboration with multiple partners to prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) and has been approved for human use in several countries. Methods: We evaluated data from three Phase 2/3 clinical trials conducted in Liberia (PREVAIL), Guinea (FLW), and Sierra Leone (STRIVE) during the 2013–2016 West African EVD outbreak to assess immune responses using validated assays. We performed a post hoc analysis of the association of vaccine response with sex, age (18–50 yrs & >50 yrs), and baseline (BL) GP-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titer (<200 & ≥200 EU/mL), including individual study (PREVAIL, FLW, or STRIVE) data and pooled data from all 3 studies. The endpoints were total IgG antibody response (EU/mL) measured by the GP-ELISA and neutralizing antibody response measured by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP at Days 28, 180, and 365 postvaccination. Results: In the overall pooled population, in all subgroups, and in each trial independently, GP-ELISA and PRNT geometric mean titers increased from BL, generally peaking at Day 28 and persisting through Day 365. Immune responses were greater in women and participants with BL GP-ELISA ≥ 200 EU/mL, but did not differ across age groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP elicits a robust and durable immune response through 12 months postvaccination in participants regardless of age, sex, or BL GP-ELISA titer. The higher immune responses observed in women and participants with pre-existing immunity are consistent with those described previously and for other vaccines.

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) provides a fine-grained description of the signal propaga-tion process, which has attracted extensive attention in the field of indoor positioning. The CSI signals collected by different fingerprint points have a high degree of discrimination due to the influence of multi-path effects. This multi-path effect is reflected in the correlation between subcarriers and anten-nas. However, in mining such correlations, previous methods are difficult to aggregate non-adjacent features, resulting in insufficient multi-path information extraction. In addition, the existence of the multi-path effect makes the relationship between the original CSI signal and the distance not obvious, and it is easy to cause mismatching of long-distance points. Therefore, this paper proposes an indoor localization algorithm that combines the multi-head self-attention mechanism and effective CSI (MHSA-EC). This algorithm is used to solve the problem where it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively aggregate long-distance CSI features and mismatches of long-distance points. This paper verifies the stability and accuracy of MHSA-EC positioning through a large number of experiments. The average positioning error of MHSA-EC is 0.71 m in the comprehensive office and 0.64 m in the laboratory. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Metaheuristic search algorithms look for solutions that either maximise or minimise a set of objectives, such as cost or performance. However most real-world optimisation problems consist of nonlinear problems with complex constraints and conflicting objectives. The process by which a GA arrives at a solution remains largely unexplained to the end-user. A poorly understood solution will dent the confidence a user has in the arrived at solution. We propose that investigation of the variables that strongly influence solution quality and their relationship would be a step toward providing an explanation of the near-optimal solution presented by a metaheuristic. Through the use of four benchmark problems we use the population data generated by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to train a surrogate model, and investigate the learning of the search space by the surrogate model. We compare what the surrogate has learned after being trained on population data generated after the first generation and contrast this with a surrogate model trained on the population data from all generations. We show that the surrogate model picks out key characteristics of the problem as it is trained on population data from each generation. Through mining the surrogate model we can build a picture of the learning process of a GA, and thus an explanation of the solution presented by the GA. The aim being to build trust and confidence in the end-user about the solution presented by the GA, and encourage adoption of the model. © 2022 ACM.},

The literature has documented several explanatory frameworks in the context of China that predominantly focus on the realm of developmental policies. Owing to the salient characteristics of the social policy arena, local adaptation of centrally designed policies may operate on distinctive logics. This study synthesizes the recent scholarship on subnational social policymaking and explains the significant interregional disparities in China's de facto urban poverty line - the eligibility standard of the urban minimum livelihood guarantee scheme, or dibao. Five research hypotheses are formulated for empirical examination: fiscal power effect, population effect, fiscal dependency effect, province effect and neighbour effect. Quantitative analysis of provincial-level panel data largely endorses the hypotheses. The remarkable subnational variations in dibao standards are explained by a salient constellation of fiscal and political factors that are embedded within the country's complex intergovernmental relations and fiscal arrangements. Both a race-to-the-top and a race-to-the-bottom may be fostered by distinctive mechanisms. The unique role of provincial governments as intermediary agents within China's political apparatus is illuminated in the social policy arena. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes whether affective polarization and (or) ideological polarization is ongoing in Brazil, what are its characteristics and whether it is concentrated in certain groups in Brazilian society. The research uses data from Eseb (2002 – 2018) and Lapop (2010 – 2019). The results indicate that: 1) there is an increase in polarization, but it is predominantly affective and more intense in relation to the candidates; 2) although there are already some signs in 2014, affective polarization is much more visible in 2018; 3) in ideology, evidence indicates a growth and radicalization of the right, which may eventually contribute to a polarization. Given this evidence, it is concluded that the specific characteristics of Brazilian polarization are related to aspects of our political context, both long-term, such as the reduced social base of the parties, and more recent ones, such as the reorganization of the right and moderation of PT. In common with other countries, there is, in Brazil, the concentration of polarization in politically engaged individuals. © 2022, Opiniao Publica. All Rights Reserved.},

Current target-generic methods typically disentangle identity features in the latent space, using adversarial training to balance privacy and utility. However, this pattern often leads to a trade-off between privacy and utility, and the latent space remains difficult to explain. To address these issues, we propose IDeudemon, which employs a "divide and conquer"strategy to protect identity and preserve utility step by step while maintaining good explainability. In Step I, we obfuscate the 3D disentangled ID code calculated by a parametric NeRF model to protect identity. In Step II, we incorporate visual similarity assistance and train a GAN with adjusted losses to preserve image utility. Thanks to the powerful 3D prior and delicate generative designs, our approach could protect the identity naturally, produce high quality details and is robust to different poses and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IDeudemon outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We propose the concept of 'explainergy', a new way of including explainability in the metaheuristic performance of algorithms solving problems in the energy domain. To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success. © 2023 IEEE.},

We take as a starting point the proposal of the theories on values proposed by Juan Díez Nicolás to dwell on the modernization theory of Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel and, specifically, on their formulation of the culturalist thesis and their classification of cultural regions. Our analysis rejects the explanation of confidence in women’s organizations taking these cultural regions as the subject of analysis, so we take countries and individuals as units of analysis. We present several multilevel models whose results show that postmaterialist values continue to be significant in explaining the variance in trust toward women’s organizations between countries. At the individual level, sex, age, educational level, income, family size, attendance at religious services, political ideology and the use of new media also help to explain the greater or less trust in women’s organizations.

According to our literature review, the economic environment in which the adjustment takes place matters. Also, the composition of the adjustment seems to be relevant to its effectiveness, with expenditure-based plans being less contractionary (or even expansionary) than tax-based plans. Our purpose is to understand, through a VAR model, which path the Portuguese economy would have followed without the EAP. Our results suggest that the austerity programme may have been harmful to economic activity in the short run, but in a longer horizon it produced a better outcome than if the EAP had not been implemented. In the absence of the EAP, the tax to GDP ratio would have been below the current ratio, with the inverse happening for the primary public expenditure ratio and for the public debt interest rate. Overall, our results support the likelihood of less disciplined fiscal accounts in the absence of the EAP. © 2022, Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra. All rights reserved.},

While training on ever-larger portions of the internet leads to consistent performance improvements, the size of these improvements diminishes with scale, and there has been little work exploring the effect of data selection on pre-training and downstream performance beyond simple de-duplication methods such as MinHash. Here, we show that careful data selection (on top of de-duplicated data) via pre-trained model embeddings can speed up training (20% efficiency gains) and improves average downstream accuracy on 16 NLP tasks (up to 2%) at the 6.7B model scale. Furthermore, we show that repeating data intelligently consistently outperforms baseline training (while repeating random data performs worse than baseline training). Our results indicate that clever data selection can significantly improve LLM pre-training, calls into question the common practice of training for a single epoch on as much data as possible, and demonstrates a path to keep improving our models past the limits of randomly sampling web data. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation.

	abstract = {The Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem that has many real-world applications. Genetic Programming is usually utilised to handle UCARP by evolving effective routing policies, which can respond to the uncertain environment in real-time. Previous studies mainly focus on the effectiveness of the routing policies but ignore the interpretability. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc interpretability, which explains a pre-trained complex routing policy. Unlike the existing explanation methods for classification/regression models, the behaviour of a routing policy is characterised as a ranking process rather than predicting a single output. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Local Ranking Explanation (LRE) method for GP-evolved routing policies for UCARP. Given a UCARP decision situation, LRE trains a linear model that gives the same ranks of the candidate tasks as those of the explained routing policy. The experimental results demonstrate that LRE can obtain more interpretable linear models that have highly correlated and consistent behaviours with the original routing policy in most decision situations. By analysing coefficients and attribute importance of the linear model, we managed to provide a local explanation of the original routing policy in a decision situation.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Although radical right parties have been extensively examined since their significant breakthrough in the European political arena in the late 80s, not enough attention has been paid to the reasons behind their unequal electoral performance (or in other words, to the cross-national and within-national variations of their success). The aim of this research is to identify the different scenarios of electoral success for radical right parties in ten European countries between 2008 and 2019. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) - a case-oriented technique which allows indepth comparative examination and which is based on the concepts of equifinality and causal heterogeneity -, we test the role of several causal conditions related to some demand-side and supply-side explanations. Our results reveal four sufficient causal paths that lead to the success of these parties, which confirm that they are able to achieve relevance in quite diverse contexts. The four paths combine both demand-side and supply-side conditions, but the role of the latter is qualitatively and quantitatively more important. In particular, we see how radical right parties can effectively take advantage of favorable political competitive dynamics, even in the absence of a priori favorable socio-economic contexts. Overall, our findings run contrary to some mechanistic explanations in the literature and support the idea of conceiving of the radical right parties as a complex, multiform phenomenon which needs to be understood through both theoretical and methodological innovations. © 2022 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

	abstract = {Introduction: Multiple scores have been developed to assess the severity of psoriasis, but these scores have many limitations. The Simplified Psoriasis Index (SPI) is a summary score with separate components for current severity (SPI-s), psychosocial impact (SPI-p), and past history and interventions (SPI-i). It is available in two similar versions: proSPI and saSPI. Aim: To assess the validity of the SPI by studying its correlation to the benchmark scores in Tunisian patients. Methods: It was a prospective bicentric study including 80 patients with plaque psoriasis. Results: The median PASI was 7.6 and the median DLQI was 9. The median proSPI-s was 6 and the median saSPI-s was 8. The median SPI-p was 7. The median SPI-i was 2. There was a strong correlation between the proSPI-s and PASI (r=0.87) and between the proSPI-s and saSPI-s (r=0.82). There was a medium correlation between saSPI-s and PASI (r=0.70) and between SPI-p and DLQI (r=0.67). The threshold value for proSPI-s and saSPI-s was 7.25. The threshold value for SPI-p was 6.5. Conclusion: The SPI aims to provide a concise but global measure of the severity and impact of psoriasis on quality of life. The use of SPI has several advantages: the simplicity of use, the additional weight given to critical locations of psoriasis, the possibility for the patient to self-assess his own disease, and the possibility of evaluating all the dimensions of psoriasis at the same time. © 2022 Maison du Medicine.

	abstract = {Objective: It is essential to utilize cardiac delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) to diagnose cardiovascular disease. By segmenting myocardium DE-MRI images, it provides critical information for the evaluation and treatment of myocardial infarction. As a consequence, it is vital to investigate the segmentation and classification technique of myocardial DE-MRI. Methods: Firstly, an end-to-end minimally supervised and semi-supervised semantic DE-MRI myocardial fibrosis segmentation framework is proposed, which combines image classification and semantic segmentation branches based on the self-attention mechanism. Following that, a residual hole network fused with the dual attention mechanism was built, and a double attention metabolic pathway classification method for cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI images was developed. Results: By adding pixel-level labels to an extra 40 training images, the segmentation model may enhance semantic segmentation performance by 2.6 percent (from 61.2 percent to 63.8 percent). When the number of pixel-level labels is increased to 80, semi-supervised feature extraction increases by 4.7 percent when compared to weakly guided semantic segmentation. Adding an attention mechanism to the critical network DRN (Deep Residual Network) can increase the classifier's performance by a small amount. Experiments revealed that the models worked effectively. Conclusion: This paper investigates the segmentation and classification of cardiac fibrosis in DE-MRI data using a semi-supervised semantic segmentation and dual attention mechanism, dealing with the issue that existing segmentation algorithms have difficulty segmenting myocardial fibrosis tissue. In the future, we can consider optimizing the design of the attention module to reduce the module computation. © 2022},

Results: During pathfinder 2, 117/136 patients with study-drug exposure of ≥600 days experienced bleeding episodes; 8.6% of bleeds were reoccurring bleeds; bleed reoccurrence decreased over time. For patients who received consistent Q4D prophylaxis across the trial (n = 61), mean ABR decreased from 3.5 bleeds/year (Year 1) to 1.6 bleeds/year (Year 6); mean FVIII trough levels stabilised at approximately 5% (Year 6). Across patients who received prophylaxis at some point during pathfinder 2 (n = 177), 125/126 (99%) reoccurring bleeds were joint bleeds. For patients receiving Q4D prophylaxis, bleeding risk generally increased as the time since the last prophylaxis dose increased. A similar reduction in ABR and stabilisation of trough level was observed in pathfinder 5. Conclusion: Long-term exposure (> 5 years) to fixed-dose N8-GP prophylaxis resulted in a protective haemostatic effect, with reduction in bleed frequency and reoccurrence, and stabilisation of FVIII trough level over time. © 2021 The Authors.
